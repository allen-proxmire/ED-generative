# Papers Index — Canonical Source of Truth

**Last updated:** 2026-07-02
**Purpose:** Single source of truth for every paper in the ED corpus. Tracks paper number (locked-in numbering), title, domain/arc assignment, status, and file location. Reflects the corpus state after Round 1 (per-paper QC), Round 2 (cross-paper audit + theorem gap-fill), Round 3 (cross-arc harmonization + SCBU + ED-SC 4.x arc), and the **2026-07-02 rebuild** (a full repo scan found the index had gone stale since 2026-05-14 — three entire arcs, a decimal-numbered sub-layer, and several standalone sections had never been added; see the maintenance note at the bottom).

**Source corpus:** `C:\Users\allen\GitHub\event-density\papers\Forcing Papers\` (legacy/working-repo location; the EDG copies referenced by file paths below live under `physics-papers/<sub-domain>/`, `position-paper/`, `layers/`, etc. in this repo).

**Status enum:**
- **WRITTEN** — paper complete in corpus.
- **DRAFTING** — actively being written.
- **PLANNED** — identified, scheduled, not yet started.
- **CANDIDATE** — on the long candidate list but not yet committed to.
- **ARCHIVED** — superseded or retired; preserved for provenance.
- **SUPERSEDED** — replaced by a later paper or restructured.

## Arc 1 — Quantum Kinematics (Papers 001–012 + decimal extensions)

The Phase-1 QM-emergence program. Sixteen theorems closing the four standard quantum-mechanical postulates as substrate-derived results. **2026-07-02: 10 decimal-slot papers added** (found missing from the 2026-05-14 index) — supplementary derivations inserted between the integer papers; they do not renumber the integer sequence.

## Arc 9 — Relativistic QM (Papers 102–116) — ADDED 2026-07-02

Never indexed until this rebuild, though fully written. Spin-statistics, Cl(3,1) frame uniqueness, anyon prohibition, Dirac/Klein-Gordon equations, minimal coupling, Lorentz representations, canonical (anti-)commutation, UV finiteness, lightlike worldlines, ℏ-origin, mass structural form, gauge rule-type existence, vacuum-particle duality, the massless slot. All papers self-identify by an internal theorem/topic code (T1–T10, hbar, ArcM-H1, GRH-D1, Q7Q8, MRR-MRP) rather than by their filename number — the sequential 102–116 numbering was imposed externally when the arc was filed into the corpus, which is the source of the two irregularities noted below.

**Numbering irregularity, confirmed 2026-07-02, not yet fixed:** 15 papers exist for 15 nominal slots (102–116), but they land as 14 filled + 1 gap (105) + 1 collision (112, two distinct files). Neither collided file's own text claims "112" — both self-identify by their theorem/topic code only, so this is purely an artifact of external numbering, not a content conflict. The T-series (T1…T10) maps cleanly onto 102, 103, 104, 106–112 if `Paper_112_LightlikeWorldlines.md` (T10) keeps slot 112; `Paper_112_hbar_Origin.md` (a topic-coded companion paper, not part of the T-sequence, already cited elsewhere in the corpus as `Paper_RQM_hbar`) is the natural candidate to fill the 105 gap instead, which would resolve both irregularities at once. **Recommended, not yet executed** — renaming a corpus file is a bigger action than an index correction; do it only with explicit sign-off, and check for any other in-corpus citations by path first.

## ED-SC 4.x Arc (Eleven-Paper Cross-Scale Extension)

Round 3 cross-scale extension arc. Identifies six SCBU-boundary projections within a unified four-regime RG model (UV / Transition / IR multi-sector / Cosmological), plus **five further papers (4.7–4.11) added 2026-07-02** extending the motif/GRF/saddle-classification/acoustic-curvature/spectral-moment statistics of the same framework.

All eleven papers sit at verdict tier M3 (FORM-FORCED + VALUE-INHERITED). Closing Paper_ED_SC_4.2 Route A (substrate-derived $\ell_{V5}(H_0)$) propagates to a **six-way simultaneous M3 → M2 verdict upgrade** across 4.1–4.6. Closing all three Routes A + B + C without additional postulates propagates to **M1** arc-wide — the first cross-arc M1 result in the corpus. *(4.7–4.11 were not independently re-audited for this same upgrade path as part of the 2026-07-02 index rebuild — flagged for a future pass.)* **Hygiene note:** a `scale invariance/` subfolder carries near-duplicate drafts of 4.7/4.8/4.9 differing only by date-stamp; not indexed separately, flagged for cleanup.

## Cosmology Arc — ADDED 2026-07-02

Inflation, BBN, CMB acoustic structure, linear structure formation, dark energy, the primordial fluctuation spectrum, baryogenesis, CCC identification, and group-embedded galaxy phenomenology, each as a substrate-inherited regime of the saturation/expansion history.

## Layers Program — ADDED 2026-07-02

"The arrow sorts the continuum": one primitive (commitment, P11) sorts continuum PDEs into layer-1 (committal, structure-making — transport, coherent Maxwell), layer-2 (dissipative, structure-erasing — diffusion, viscosity, Gaussianity, one shared Laplacian operator), and the edge (structure-preserving, needs the arrow absent — solitons, a measured negative). Capstone paper `physics-papers/substrate-evaluation/Paper_TheArrowSortsTheContinuum.md` is already indexed in the Substrate-Evaluation Wave section below; this section indexes the working-notes arc it was built from, which lives in `layers/` and had never been indexed itself.

## Substrate-Evaluation Wave + Post-Pivot Gravity (June–July 2026)

Ten standalone papers from the substrate-evaluation program (build-and-run / theorem-anchored tests of the certified Σ-rule substrate) and the post-pivot Arc ED-10 curvature-emergence line. Distinct naming convention; no numbered slots consumed. Each paper carries a does-NOT-claim preamble, a P/D/I load-bearing audit, and falsifier sentences; `.pdf` builds accompany the `.md` sources.

Notes: GR-I/GR-II are the post-pivot curvature-emergence results, sharpening (not superseding) the Arc-3 scalar-tensor/MOND papers — see GR-I §7 / GR-II §9 for the explicit reconciliation. Form-and-Flesh is the program reach-statement (the empirical successor to the Contrast-First ontology paper) and lives in `position-paper/` alongside it. Underlying simulation artifacts live in the working repo (`event-density/evaluation/` and `event-density/foundations/`). **The Hawking-2π addendum lives with Arc 4 (Black Holes) above, not here, since its file path is `physics-papers/black-hole/`.**

## Position Papers — ADDED 2026-07-02

Foundational/ontological framing documents distinct from the per-domain derivation arcs. Live in `position-paper/`.

| Title | Status | File |
|---|---|---|
| Event Density: A Program Review (14-section map of the ~125-paper corpus, tiered; own Zenodo DOI) | WRITTEN | `position-paper/ED_Program_Review.md` (+ `.pdf`) |
| Event Density (front-door whitepaper) | WRITTEN | `position-paper/ED_WHITEPAPER.md` |
| When Contrast Becomes Fact — the Contrast-First Ontology ("the Facts paper") | WRITTEN | `position-paper/paper_ED_Contrast_First_Ontology.md` (**hygiene flag**: this file has no H1 heading, opens directly at `## Abstract` — a real source-file gap, not fixed as part of this index-only pass) |
| The Event Density Framework: A 13-Primitive Generative System and Its Cross-Domain Reach | WRITTEN | `position-paper/paper_ED_Framework_13_Primitive_Generative_System.md` |

Note: this third entry is a distinct document from `Paper_087_13Primitives.md` (Arc 8) — same underlying content genre, different framing/date, not a duplicate.

## Total counts (2026-07-02 rebuild)

- **Numbered Papers (001–101), including 21 decimal-slot extensions:** 122 WRITTEN + 1 ARCHIVED (008 legacy)
- **Arc 9 Relativistic QM (102–116):** 14 WRITTEN + 1 MISSING (105 gap) — 15 filename slots, 15 files (one slot, 112, doubly occupied)
- **Matter-Sector Arc (MS-I, MS-II):** 1 WRITTEN + 1 ARCHIVED
- **Theorem stubs (T19, T20, T21):** 3 WRITTEN
- **Cross-arc synthesis (SCBU):** 1 WRITTEN
- **ED-SC 4.x arc extensions (4.1–4.11):** 11 WRITTEN
- **Dynamics / GW arc:** 8 WRITTEN
- **Cosmology arc:** 9 WRITTEN
- **Layers program:** 12 WRITTEN
- **Predictions / Falsification:** 5 WRITTEN
- **Substrate-evaluation wave + post-pivot gravity:** 17 WRITTEN
- **Position papers:** 3 WRITTEN

**Grand total: 209 distinct corpus entities** (203 WRITTEN + 1 MISSING slot + 2 ARCHIVED + 1 doubly-occupied slot counted once above, net of the 105/112 irregularity). This is a large jump from the 2026-05-14 count of 124 — three entire arcs (Relativistic QM, Dynamics, Cosmology) plus the decimal-slot layer, the Layers program, five more scale-correspondence papers, three position papers, and a handful of loose files had simply never been added to this index, not newly written in the interim (most of these files carry May 2026 dates).

**Registry state (per Round-3 final rebuild, 2026-05-14 — NOT re-audited in the 2026-07-02 pass, flagged stale rather than guessed):**
- Paper-specific postulates: 125 (zero WARN-dup name collisions) — *as of 2026-05-14; almost certainly higher now given ~85 additional papers found since.*
- Foundational theorems: 8 (T17, T18, T19, T20, T21, GR1, N1, UR-1)
- Top-3 most-cited upstream papers: Paper_087 (96), Paper_090 (51), Paper_089 (49) — *as of 2026-05-14.*
- Orphan papers: 10 (as of 2026-05-14) — *not recomputed.*

## Maintenance discipline

- **Each new paper:** add an entry here when promoted from CANDIDATE → PLANNED → DRAFTING → WRITTEN.
- **Round-numbered audit suffix `_FIXED`:** several files in the corpus carry a `_FIXED` suffix from Round 1 QC. The file paths in this index use the base name (no `_FIXED` suffix) for stability; treat `Paper_NNN_*.md` and `Paper_NNN_*_FIXED.md` as the same entity when both exist.
- **Cross-references in paper §3 sections:** reference papers by paper number (Paper_NNN) for in-corpus citations; by file path for repository-migration purposes.
- **Locked-in numbering:** the 001–101 numbering is stable as of 2026-05-14; **102–116 (Arc 9) added 2026-07-02**, with one known gap (105) and one known collision (112) not yet resolved (see Arc 9 section). T-stubs, SCBU, ED-SC 4.x, MS-I/II, Dynamics, Cosmology, and the Substrate-Evaluation Wave all use distinct naming conventions and do not consume numbered slots.
- **Decimal-slot convention (new, 2026-07-02):** supplementary papers inserted between integer slots (e.g. `012.6`) are genuine, complete papers, not drafts — file them under their parent arc's table at the position implied by the decimal, and do not renumber the surrounding integers to accommodate them.
- **Path-prefix inconsistency (flagged, not fixed):** the original 001–101 rows list bare filenames with no directory prefix, while every section added or touched since 2026-06 (Substrate-Evaluation Wave onward) uses full relative paths. The bare filenames are known to actually live under `physics-papers/<sub-domain>/` like everything else; retrofitting all ~101 legacy rows with full paths is a real but separate cleanup task, out of scope for this rebuild.
- **Registry source of truth:** for the live citation graph, postulate inventory, and numerical-value registry, see `event-density/papers/Forcing Papers/_RegistryRound2/` — **stale since 2026-05-14, not recomputed in this rebuild** (see Total counts section above).
- **2026-07-02 rebuild provenance:** this pass was a full repo scan (three parallel research agents, cross-verified against direct file reads) triggered by discovering the index was nearly two months stale. It is believed complete for the directories scanned (`physics-papers/*`, `position-paper/`, `layers/`, `scale correspondence/`, `predictions/`, root-level `.md` files) but was not cross-checked against `event-density/` (the working repo) beyond the specific loose files named above — the working repo has its own much larger body of in-progress notes that this index does not and should not attempt to track.
