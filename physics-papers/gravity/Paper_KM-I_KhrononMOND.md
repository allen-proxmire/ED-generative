## Preamble: What This Paper Does NOT Claim *(written first per QC discipline; abstract reconciled against this)*

1. **The 13 substrate primitives are not derived** (position paper, Paper_087).
2. **The MOND deep-field exponent is not derived from primitives.** The khronon's deep-infrared kinetic structure is **uniquely fixed by matching the Combination Rule the corpus already derived** (Paper_030) — *forced-given-030* — and the paper says so wherever it matters. The khronon **embeds** the substrate's geometric-mean law relativistically; it does not re-derive it. The primitives-level origin of the deep-IR branch is a declared open question, deliberately not attempted.
3. **`a₀ = cH₀/(2π)` is inherited** (Paper_029, from the cosmic decoupling surface, Paper_028), not re-derived. What this paper adds is the structural carrier: the scale is the khronon's own background rate.
4. **No value of the cosmological constant is derived.** §7's vacuum-term resonance (`ρ_Λ ∼ H₀²c²/G`) is an order-of-magnitude *form* consistency — the khronon's only scale is the cosmic rate — fully inside the corpus's value-inherited stance. The reconciliation with the corpus's V1-backreaction reading of Λ (Paper_038.5) is flagged open, not performed.
5. **The interpolation between the two fixed asymptotics is a family** — now a *Cassini-constrained* family (slow-saturating members excluded by ephemerides) — and no member is load-bearing for any claim here.
6. **The cosmological regulator sector is a family** (sequestered from everything tested; §7), with its own constraints (BBN, Čerenkov, FRW stability). No member is selected; selecting one is model-building, outside this paper.
7. **Class-level results are inherited and labeled.** That khronometric theories with non-canonical acceleration kinetics yield MOND in the static weak field is established literature (the Blanchet–Marsat construction; the generalized-aether results of Zlosnik–Ferreira–Starkman), used here as the external dictionary — exactly as Lovelock's theorem was used in GR-II. Reported stability corners of this class are cited as reported, **not independently verified here**.
8. **Clusters and the CMB are not addressed.** Reproducing galactic MOND phenomenology does not resolve the known cluster-scale missing-mass shortfall or cosmological structure formation; those debts land on ED's cosmology/SCBU sector and are flagged wherever relevant.
9. **GR-I and GR-II are inherited**, not re-derived: the bandwidth metric, the lapse `N² ∼ b`, the khronometric class, `c_T = c`, and Lorentz safety are inputs.

## Abstract

GR-II identified Event Density's gravitational class as **khronometric**: Einstein's tensor sector plus one scalar — the khronon, the substrate's arrow of time made dynamical, anchored to the cosmological rest frame. This paper shows that the same scalar naturally carries the **dark-matter phenomenology** of ED's published gravity arc, unifying the corpus's two gravity programs into one theory. The construction has one missing span and two built ends. The ends: the khronon (GR-II), and the MOND sector — `a₀ = cH₀/(2π)` from the cosmic decoupling surface (Paper_029), the Combination Rule `a = √(a_N a₀)` (Paper_030), BTFR (Paper_031), the MOND field equation (Paper_036). The span: the khronon's kinetic structure. Promoting the khronometric acceleration term to a function `W(A²)` of the congruence acceleration — the established khronometric-MOND structure — the static weak field reduces to the **modified Poisson equation in the metric potential itself**, `∇·[μ_{\rm tot}∇Φ] = 4πGρ` with `μ_{\rm tot} = 1 + c_1W'`. The high-acceleration limit is GR-I, untouched (commitment-linearity ⟹ `μ → 1`); the deep-infrared limit is **uniquely fixed by matching Paper_030** (`μ_{\rm tot} → x`, forced-given-030), embedding the Combination Rule and BTFR relativistically — at the surfaced cost of an **infrared cancellation** (the khronon takes over the static constraint below `a₀`), standard in this class. Statics isolate the construction: `θ = σ = 0` for the aligned khronon, so the MOND carrier is the *unique* active foliation term, and the ED identity `a_i = ½∂_i\ln b` reads the whole sector in substrate language — *the deep field switches on where bandwidth gradients fall below the cosmic rate.* **The historical kill-checks pass structurally**: lensing tracks the MOND potential with **no added vector field** (the modification is metric-borne; the conformal-coupling disease TeVeS patched never arises; slip is `O(Φ)`-suppressed); no new ghost (the `W`-sector adds no time derivatives in unitary gauge); the classic AQUAL ellipticity conditions hold; screening is PPN-safe in the linear khronometric corner. The one soft spot — the `A → 0` degeneracy — is resolved without retrofit: the degenerate point is **exact Minkowski vacuum, which is not in ED's state space** (the substrate always ticks), the pure-`A²` form is a truncation whose generic completion `𝒲(A², Θ)` is healthy at the physical cosmological point, and an **orthogonality theorem** (`θ ≡ 0` in statics) sequesters the regulator family from everything tested. The khronon's cosmological face ties the arc to SCBU — **one scale, `H₀`, in four roles** (background rate, `a₀`, horizon locus, `R_H` boundary) — and its infrared vacuum term is naturally of order `ρ_Λ ∼ H₀²c²/G`, the observed dark-energy order, read as single-scale consistency (form-tier only). The result: **one khronometric gravity** — Einstein at high accelerations, MOND in the deep field, dark energy's order carried — in which "dark matter" is *the deep-infrared regime of the arrow's own field*. No particle, no added vector, no new primitive. Clusters and the CMB remain owed.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 What this paper does

ED's gravity corpus contained two programs. The published arc (Papers 025–038) derived Newton, the transition acceleration `a₀ = cH₀/(2π)`, the Combination Rule, and BTFR — the dark-matter-free account of galactic dynamics — covariantized in Paper_033 on a *postulated* metric with a *postulated* scalar. The post-pivot arc (GR-I/II) *derived* the metric (the bandwidth metric, with the weak-field Einstein tests) and *derived* the scalar (the khronon: the arrow made dynamical). This paper supplies the one missing identification: **the postulated scalar of the MOND arc is the derived scalar of the curvature arc.** It proceeds in four steps: the mapping (§3), the static weak-field reduction with the GR and MOND limits (§4), the lensing and viability checks (§5–§6), and the cosmological regulator with the SCBU tie-in (§7).

### 1.2 Why this matters

Three reasons. First, **unification**: the corpus's two gravity lines fuse into one theory with one extra field — and that field was not added for the purpose; it was *counted* by GR-II's mode analysis before MOND was on the table. Second, **the dark-matter claim sharpens**: "no dark matter; modified dynamics below `a₀`" becomes "the galactic phenomenology is the deep-infrared regime of the preferred-foliation scalar" — a specific field with an independent origin (the arrow), independent constraints (GW170817, PPN, pulsars), and independent predictions (a breathing GW mode; wide-binary deviations). Third, **the historical failure modes are addressed structurally, not by patches**: the constructions that killed earlier relativistic MOND (conformal couplings blind to lensing; added vectors; fine-tuned `a₀`) are each avoided by something ED already had.

### 1.3 How this fits the arc

- **Papers 027–031, 036:** Newton; `a₀`; Combination Rule; BTFR; the MOND field equation. *(the deep-field end — inherited)*
- **Paper_033:** scalar-tensor covariantization on a postulated metric and scalar. *(fused here: the scalar is identified)*
- **Paper GR-I:** the bandwidth metric; weak-field Einstein tests. *(the high-acceleration end — inherited)*
- **Paper GR-II:** the khronometric class; the khronon; `c_T = c`; Lorentz safety. *(the field itself — inherited)*
- **Paper KM-I (this paper):** the unification — the khronon's deep field is the MOND sector.

This completes the second of the two reconciliation items GR-I §7 declared open (the khronon↔MOND relation); the first (the bandwidth↔strain/flow substrate-route identification) remains open.

### 1.4 Conventions and regime of validity

Signature `(−,+,+,+)`; `c = 1` where convenient. The derivations are **static, weak-field, quasi-spherical**, in the **continuum (DCGT) limit**; the cosmological statements (§7) are FRW-background structural results. **No strong-field, no time-dependent-lensing, no cluster, and no CMB claims are made.** Exact numerical coefficients in the reductions are convention-dependent and carried schematically (`c₁`-type constants of order unity); the *structures* and *limits* are the results.

---

## 2. Primitive Inputs

**Substrate primitives (postulated, Paper_087):** P11/P13 (the arrow and the tick — the khronon's origin, via GR-II), P04 (bandwidth — the metric and lapse, via GR-I), P02/P05 (adjacency/transport). The Σ-selection's orientation-blindness and P-Commitment-Linear (GR-I) enter through the inherited results.

**Inherited results (load-bearing):**

- **GR-I:** `g_{ij} ∼ b^{-1}`, `N² ∼ b`, the weak-field Schwarzschild metric; P-Commitment-Linear ⟹ the Einstein branch at high accelerations.
- **GR-II:** the khronometric class; the khronon `T` with `u_μ = ∂_μT/\sqrt{X}` hypersurface-orthogonal; the preferred frame = the cosmological rest frame; `c_T = c`; universal Lorentz violation.
- **Paper_029:** `a₀ = cH₀/(2π)` (value anchored to `H₀`).
- **Paper_030:** the Combination Rule `a = √(a_N a₀)` (the substrate's own deep-field law, via the P14 bilocal coupling).
- **Papers_031/036:** BTFR; the MOND field equation (the flat-space form this paper's static limit must and does land on).

**External dictionary (inherited mathematics/physics, labeled I):**

- **Khronometric/aether-MOND** (Blanchet–Marsat 2011; Zlosnik–Ferreira–Starkman 2007): a preferred-foliation scalar with non-canonical *acceleration* kinetics yields the MOND modified-Poisson equation in the static weak field, with the interpolation given by the kinetic function's derivative. The class's reported stability corners are cited as reported.
- **Classical AQUAL well-posedness** (Bekenstein–Milgrom): ellipticity conditions `μ > 0`, `d(xμ)/dx > 0`.

**No new primitive is introduced; no primitive forcing is invoked.** The paper's single structural commitment beyond inheritance is the *typing* of the kinetic sector (the acceleration invariant, §3.2) — which is argued, not assumed, since the alternative typing fails independently.

## 3. The Mapping: One Missing Span, Two Built Ends

### 3.1 The ends

**The field (GR-II).** ED's arrow lives in the law, forcing a preferred foliation; the propagating content is 2 tensor modes + 1 scalar — the khronon, whose background is cosmic time and whose background rate is the Hubble rate.

**The law and the scale (Papers 028–031, 036).** `a₀ = cH₀/(2π)` from the decoupling surface; the Combination Rule `a = √(a_N a₀)`; BTFR; and the flat-space MOND field equation this construction's static limit must reproduce.

### 3.2 The span, and its typing

The missing piece is the khronon's kinetic structure. Its **typing is argued, not chosen**: a kinetic function of `(∂T)²` fails twice over — in statics `(∂T)² ≈ 1 - 2Φ - |∇τ|²` depends on the *potential*, not its gradient (yielding screening-type physics, never `μ(|∇Φ|/a₀)`), and its conformally-coupled variant is the historical RAQUAL construction that fails lensing. The correct carrier is the **acceleration of the khronon congruence**, `a_μ = ⊥_μ^ν∇_ν\ln\sqrt{X}` — and this stays inside the foliation EFT GR-II already counted: the general quadratic sector is `λθ² + βσ_{μν}σ^{μν} + α\,a_μa^μ`, and the MOND extension promotes **only the acceleration term**:

$$
S_T = \frac{1}{16\pi G}\int d^4x\,\sqrt{-g}\;\Big[\,R + \lambda\,\theta^2 + \beta\,\sigma_{\mu\nu}\sigma^{\mu\nu} + a_0^2\,W\!\big(A^2\big)\Big],
\qquad A^2 = \frac{a_\mu a^\mu}{a_0^2},
$$

with matter coupled to `g_{\mu\nu}` **only** (universal coupling — in ED, matter *is* substrate content; there is no conformal matter frame to mis-couple). `W` is carried as a general function; its two asymptotics are fixed in §4, the region between them is an honest family.

**The scale's structural carrier.** The khronon's vacuum is the Hubble flow, so the only rate available to normalize its local gradients is the cosmic rate: the comparison "local acceleration against `cH₀`" is not a model choice but the field's only option. **`a₀` is the khronon's background scale** — the Milgrom coincidence `a₀ ≈ cH₀/2π` acquires a carrier (the coefficient `1/2π` stays inherited from Paper_029).

---

## 4. The Static Weak-Field Reduction

### 4.1 Alignment, isolation, and the ED identity

Static, time-reversal-symmetric sources align the khronon (`T = t`; the misalignment `τ` is odd under the symmetry), making its congruence the static observers', whose kinematics are textbook: `θ = 0`, `σ = 0`, `a_i = ∂_i\ln N`. Two consequences:

1. **Statics isolate the MOND carrier.** The `λ` and `β` sectors are inert (`θ = σ = 0`); the acceleration function is the *unique* active foliation term in statics. The MOND modification and the static modification are the same term — by kinematics, not tuning. (The `β`-sector governs the tensor speed: `c_T = c` from GR-II is untouched by `W`.)
2. **The ED identity.** GR-I derived `N² ∼ b`, so

   $$
   a_i = \partial_i \ln N = \tfrac{1}{2}\,\partial_i \ln b :
   $$

   **the khronon's acceleration is the logarithmic bandwidth gradient.** In substrate language, the deep field switches on *where bandwidth gradients fall below the cosmic rate.*

### 4.2 The modified Poisson equation

With `g_{00} = -(1+2Φ)` and `A² = |∇Φ|²/a_0^2` at leading order, varying the action gives (schematic order-unity constants flagged as conventional):

$$
\nabla\cdot\Big[\,\mu_{\rm tot}\!\left(\tfrac{|\nabla\Phi|}{a_0}\right)\nabla\Phi\,\Big] = 4\pi G\rho,
\qquad
\mu_{\rm tot}(x) = 1 + c_1\,W'(x^2)
$$

— the AQUAL form, **in the metric potential itself** (not an auxiliary scalar). The `Ψ`-equation receives the khronon's stress, whose anisotropic part is second order in the potentials (§5).

### 4.3 The GR limit

At high accelerations `W' → α`, a small constant — the standard quadratic khronometric coupling, PPN-bounded. Then `μ_{\rm tot} → 1`, `Φ = Ψ` at leading order, and **GR-I's weak-field Schwarzschild sector — the factor-of-two bending, redshift, precession — is untouched.** The residual `O(α)` preferred-frame effects are GR-II §8's standing `α₁, α₂` front, unchanged. ED-side, this limit is enforced: P-Commitment-Linear demands the Einstein branch at strong gradients — the screening regime is GR-I, not an option.

### 4.4 The deep-IR limit — forced-given-030, with the cost stated

Matching the corpus's derived deep-field law (`μ_{\rm tot} → x` so that, by Gauss-law integration, `|∇Φ| = \sqrt{a_N a_0}`) fixes the deep-IR kinetic behavior **uniquely**:

$$
W'(x^2) \;\xrightarrow{\,x \to 0\,}\; -\frac{1}{c_1} + \frac{x}{c_1} + \ldots
$$

Two pieces with two statuses. The non-analytic linear piece is the MOND carrier — the `X^{3/2}`-type term, forced-given-030. The constant `-1/c_1` is the **infrared cancellation**: in the convention where Einstein–Hilbert keeps its normalization, the khronon must cancel the Einstein gradient term in the static constraint below `a₀` and take it over. This is standard in the class (the negative-branch kinetic function of generalized-aether MOND) — but it is the construction's single most delicate requirement, surfaced here rather than hidden, and stress-tested in §6. With it, the Combination Rule and BTFR slope-4 (`v⁴ = GMa₀`) are **embedded relativistically** — the khronon carries Paper_030's law; it does not re-derive it.

---

## 5. The Lensing Verdict

**The check.** Galactic lensing must track the MOND potential — the historical killer of relativistic MOND.

**Why this construction is on the right side of history.** The modification is **metric-borne**: §4.2 MONDifies the *metric potential*; matter and light couple universally to `g_{\mu\nu}`; there is no conformal scalar sector. RAQUAL failed lensing because its scalar coupled conformally and conformal factors do not deflect light — the *same* conformal-blindness fact GR-I §6 used to exclude Nordström. TeVeS's vector field was a patch for that disease; **the khronon never has the disease the patch was for.**

**The slip.** The khronon's anisotropic stress is `∼ W' a_{\langle i}a_{j\rangle} = O(|∇Φ|²)` — second order in the potentials; even deep in the MOND regime its ratio to the leading terms is `O(Φ) ∼ 10^{-6}` for galaxies. Hence `Φ = Ψ\,[1 + O(Φ)]`, both potentials are the MONDified potential, and the deflection is `∝ 2∫∇_\perp Φ_{\rm MOND}`:

> **Galactic lensing tracks the MOND potential, with no added vector field.** The kill-check passes at leading order — for the same structural reason ED's gravity produced the factor of two: space and time potentials move together.

Caveats: leading-order, static; cluster-scale lensing inherits the MOND shortfall (preamble 8); the slip suppression presumes the healthy perturbations §6 addresses.

---

## 6. Viability: Ghosts, Ellipticity, Screening, and the τ-Mode

### 6.1 No new ghost (structural)

In unitary gauge `a_i = ∂_i\ln N` — spatial gradients of the lapse only — so the `W`-sector contributes **no time derivatives at any order**. The scalar's time-kinetic structure is the `λ, β` sector, untouched by the MOND generalization: **the no-ghost condition of the unified theory is the linear khronometric one.** (The `W`-sector can feed the effective kinetic matrix through constraint elimination; that feedback is exactly the §7 degeneracy item, not a second pathology.)

### 6.2 Static well-posedness (the classic conditions)

The perturbed static operator has the AQUAL coefficients; the Bekenstein–Milgrom conditions `μ_{\rm tot} > 0` and `d(x\,μ_{\rm tot})/dx > 0` hold across the interpolation — deep IR (`μ = x`) passes both. **The infrared cancellation does not destabilize statics: `W' < 0` there, but the *total* operator is healthy.**

### 6.3 Screening and the constrained family

Screening is the smallness of the residual, not Vainshtein: at solar accelerations (`x ∼ 10⁷–10⁸`) the force correction is the saturation tail plus `O(α)` preferred-frame terms. Two channels, kept distinct: the **`α₁, α₂` channel** (the linear corner; pulsar-tested; the standing GR-II falsification front, unchanged) and the **interpolation-tail channel**, where Cassini-class ephemeris bounds **exclude slow-saturating families** (inverse-power tails at the edge of exclusion; exponential tails survive). The interpolation is thereby a *constrained* family — measured, not protected.

### 6.4 The τ-mode

In unitary gauge the khronon perturbation is eaten: it **is** the breathing scalar GR-II already counted — not a new player. Benign as screened at high accelerations (dipole radiation suppressed with the scalar charge); its deep-IR dynamics (bars, mergers, satellites, wide binaries) are the theory's *predictive* sector. Its only pathology channel is the §7 degeneracy — one soft spot, one address.

---

## 7. The Regulator and the Cosmological Face

### 7.1 The degenerate point is not in ED's state space

The pure-`A²` sector degenerates as `A → 0` (vanishing stiffness, slowing modes) — but the configuration `(A, θ) = (0, 0)` at which the structure fails is **exact Minkowski vacuum, eternal and inert — and ED has no Minkowski vacuum.** The khronon's background is the Hubble flow; the tick does not halt and commitment does not cease (P13, P11). The degenerate point sits on the excluded boundary of the substrate's state space. This is a domain observation, not a modification of `W`.

### 7.2 The truncation diagnosis and the regulator family

`W(A²)` was a truncation: the foliation EFT's invariants are `a`, `θ`, `σ`, and nothing singles out the acceleration as the sole argument of the IR structure. The general sector `\mathcal{W}(A², Θ)` (`Θ = θ/3H₀`) is **non-degenerate at the physical near-vacuum** `(A → 0, Θ ∼ 1)`, where the expansion supplies the stiffness. The `Θ`-form is **not forced** — the **regulator family**, labeled.

### 7.3 The orthogonality theorem

`θ ≡ 0` for static congruences, so **every `Θ`-term vanishes identically in statics: the entire tested sector of this paper (§4–§6) is invariant under the regulator choice.** The family is sequestered — it cannot be tuned to help the galactic physics (no leak-back), and the galactic physics cannot vouch for it (no protection). Two independently falsifiable sectors.

### 7.4 The SCBU tie-in, and one tiered resonance

The khronon has exactly one background scale, and it appears in four roles: the background rate (`H₀`), the transition acceleration (`a₀ = cH₀/2π`), the horizon locus (`b → 0`, GR-I), and SCBU's unified boundary (`R_H = c/H₀`). **One scale, four roles: the SCBU boundary acquires a dynamical carrier — its field is the khronon.** And the IR sector's vacuum term is naturally of order

$$
\rho_\Lambda \sim \frac{a_0^2 c^2}{G} \sim \frac{H_0^2 c^2}{G}
$$

— the observed dark-energy order: the long-noticed `Λ ∼ a₀²` coincidence read as **single-scale consistency** (the khronon's only scale is the cosmic rate, so its vacuum term can only be that size). Tiered hard: form/order-of-magnitude only; the `O(1)` constant is not derived; `Λ ∼ H₀²` is a consistency relation, not a prediction; and the reconciliation with the corpus's V1-backreaction Λ (Paper_038.5) is open.

### 7.5 Filters on the family

The regulator family carries its own constraints: **BBN** (the `λθ²` sector renormalizes cosmological `G`; bounded), **gravitational Čerenkov** (admissible members must give `c_s ∼ O(1)` at the cosmological point — the bare truncation fails this in voids, independently confirming §7.2's diagnosis), and **FRW stability**. Pinning a member is model-building, outside this paper — the same epistemic boundary GR-II drew for the khronon parameters.

---

## 8. Position Relative to the Published Arc — the Fusion

- **Paper_033's scalar is the khronon.** The pre-pivot arc *constructed* a scalar `Φ` on a postulated metric (both labeled postulates in its own audit); the post-pivot arc *derived* a scalar with exactly the required role and origin. The two gravity programs fuse: Paper_036's MOND field equation is this paper's §4.2 static limit; Paper_033's covariantized equation is its covariant form, with the postulated background replaced by GR-I's metric.
- **Paper_033/034's "deep-MOND superluminality cost" is the khronon's known class character** — what makes universal horizons exist — and not a causal pathology given the foliation: a flagged cost becomes an expected feature.
- **GR-I §7's open item #2 (khronon↔MOND) is hereby closed**; open item #1 (bandwidth↔strain/flow) remains.
- **"Dark matter" in ED**: the galactic phenomenology is carried by the same field that carries the arrow of time — no particle, no added vector, no new primitive; the field was counted (GR-II) before it was needed (here).

---

## 9. The Wedge — Empirical Content

1. **Wide binaries near `a₀`** — the live observational frontier where this theory and Newtonian expectations genuinely diverge; an active measurement program, and the cleanest near-term discriminator.
2. **Dynamical MOND** — the τ-mode's excitation in time-dependent galactic systems is where MOND-class dynamics differ from particle dark matter; predictive territory, not yet computed.
3. **The breathing GW polarization** (GR-II's scalar mode) — now identified as the *same* field that does the galactic work: one detection channel, two phenomenologies.
4. **The constrained families as shrinking falsifiable space** — Cassini on the interpolation; BBN/Čerenkov/FRW on the regulator: the theory's unfixed sectors are being measured, not protected.
5. **What is *not* claimed as a wedge:** clusters and the CMB (owed); the value of `Λ` (form-tier only); solar-system deviations beyond the standing `α₁, α₂` front.

---

## 10. Falsification Criteria

### 10.1 Lensing slip in the MOND regime

**Falsifier sentence:** *Observation of a leading-order gravitational slip (`Φ ≠ Ψ` beyond `O(Φ)` corrections) in galactic lensing relative to dynamics would falsify §5's metric-borne mechanism — the construction has no vector field to repair it with.*

### 10.2 The Combination-Rule embedding

**Falsifier sentence:** *Galactic data inconsistent with `a = √(a_N a₀)` in the deep field (or BTFR slope-4 with the inherited `a₀`) falsifies the deep-IR matching — and with it the unification, since the deep-IR form is forced-given-030.*

### 10.3 Wide binaries

**Falsifier sentence:** *Wide-binary samples near `a₀` showing purely Newtonian behavior at the precision where the deep-IR branch predicts deviation would falsify the unscreened sector.*

### 10.4 The interpolation family closes

**Falsifier sentence:** *Ephemeris (Cassini-class) bounds tightening to exclude all interpolation members compatible with the two fixed asymptotics would falsify the construction's middle — there is no mechanism here to evade the static sector's own equation.*

### 10.5 The AQUAL conditions

**Falsifier sentence:** *A demonstration that `μ_{\rm tot} > 0` or `d(xμ_{\rm tot})/dx > 0` must fail somewhere on the physical interpolation would falsify static well-posedness (§6.2).*

### 10.6 The regulator family empties

**Falsifier sentence:** *A proof that no `𝒲(A², Θ)` member simultaneously satisfies BBN, Čerenkov, and FRW-stability filters while remaining `Θ`-trivial in statics would falsify the §7 resolution of the degeneracy — returning the `A → 0` soft spot to the theory's ledger as unresolved.*

### 10.7 Preferred-frame parameters (standing)

**Falsifier sentence:** *The GR-II falsification front (`α₁, α₂` above bounds once the rule is pinned) carries over unchanged: the unification adds no protection against it.*

## 11. Position Statement

**Event-Density gravity is one khronometric theory, and its dark-matter phenomenology is the deep-infrared regime of the khronon — the arrow of time made dynamical.** Given the inherited ends — the khronon and its cosmic anchoring (GR-II), the metric and lapse (GR-I), the scale `a₀ = cH₀/2π` (Paper_029) and the deep-field law (Paper_030) — the khronometric acceleration sector with a general kinetic function reduces, in the static weak field, to the AQUAL equation in the metric potential; the high-acceleration limit is GR-I (enforced by commitment-linearity); the deep-infrared limit embeds the Combination Rule and BTFR (forced-given-030, with the infrared cancellation surfaced); lensing tracks the MOND potential with no added vector; no new ghost arises; the classic ellipticity conditions hold; screening is PPN-safe with a Cassini-constrained interpolation family; the `A → 0` degeneracy is resolved at the level of ED's state space (no Minkowski vacuum) and EFT generality (the sequestered regulator family); and the khronon's cosmological face carries SCBU's one scale in four roles, with a vacuum term naturally of the observed dark-energy order (form-tier).

**What this paper claims.** The unification: the corpus's MOND sector and its curvature sector are one khronometric theory; the postulated scalar of Paper_033 is the derived khronon of GR-II; the deep-field law is embedded, the historical kill-checks (lensing foremost) pass structurally, and the open sectors are honest, sequestered, and independently constrained families.

**What this paper does not claim.** The MOND exponent is not derived from primitives (forced-given-030); `a₀` and `G` are inherited; no value of `Λ` is derived; no interpolation or regulator member is selected; the class's stability corners are cited, not re-verified; clusters and the CMB are not addressed; and the primitives-level origin of the deep-infrared branch — *why* the substrate's response goes geometric-mean below the cosmic rate — remains the deepest declared open question.

**Series context.** Paper KM-I of the post-pivot curvature-emergence line, companion to GR-I and GR-II — and the fusion point with the published gravity arc (Papers 025–038). The remaining work is phenomenology (pin the rule; pin the families; compute the dynamical MOND sector) and the guarded origin question.

### Glossary

- **Khronon.** The preferred-foliation scalar (GR-II): ED's arrow made dynamical; background = cosmic time.
- **Congruence acceleration `a_μ`.** `⊥∇_μ\ln\sqrt{X}`; in statics `a_i = ∂_i\ln N = ½∂_i\ln b` — the log-bandwidth gradient. The kinetic invariant of the MOND sector.
- **`W(A²)` / `𝒲(A², Θ)`.** The acceleration kinetic function and its regulated completion; `μ_{\rm tot} = 1 + c_1W'`.
- **Forced-given-030.** The deep-IR form is uniquely fixed by matching the corpus's independently-derived Combination Rule — an embedding, not a primitives derivation.
- **The infrared cancellation.** `W' → -1/c_1` as `A → 0`: the khronon takes over the static constraint below `a₀`; standard-in-class, the construction's delicate piece.
- **Orthogonality theorem.** `θ ≡ 0` in statics ⟹ the regulator family is invisible to everything tested.
- **Regulator family.** The `Θ`-sector of `𝒲`: open, sequestered, filtered by BBN/Čerenkov/FRW stability.
- **One scale, four roles.** `H₀` as the khronon background rate, `a₀`, the `b→0` horizon, and the SCBU boundary.
- **Deep field.** The khronon's `A ≲ 1` regime — ED's account of dark-matter phenomenology.

**End of Paper KM-I.**

*Post-pivot curvature-emergence line, fusion point with the published gravity arc. The khronon — the arrow made dynamical — carries ED's dark-matter phenomenology: GR at high accelerations (enforced), the Combination Rule and BTFR below `a₀` (embedded, forced-given-030), lensing correct with no added vector (metric-borne), no new ghost, PPN-safe, with the `A→0` degeneracy resolved at the state-space and EFT-generality level and the regulator sequestered by the orthogonality theorem. One scale (`H₀`) in four roles ties the theory to SCBU, and the khronon's vacuum term is naturally of the dark-energy order (form-tier). No particle, no vector, no new primitive. Clusters/CMB owed; origin question guarded.*
