# Event Density — The Master Predictions List

**Allen Proxmire · July 2026 · every falsifiable, checkable claim the program currently makes, in one place**

This consolidates three existing documents — `Predictions_and_Falsifiers.md` (gravity), `Paper_ED_Predictions_Bundle.md` (cross-domain, 13 predictions), and `Paper_056_ClassA_Wall.md` (quantum-coherence mass wall) — plus the matter-sector predictions from `Paper_MS-II_MatterSectorFromTheArrow.md`, which were not previously gathered into a predictions document. Nothing here is new physics; this is a reorganization by domain with tier and falsifier stated for each, so the whole falsifiable surface of the program can be read in one sitting.

**Updated 2026-07-05:** a corpus-wide sweep found killable predictions living in source papers but absent here. Added: the merging-cluster offset-velocity knee (1.13), the DF2/DF4 group-suppression knee (1.14), the anyon prohibition and spin-statistics falsifiers (3.5–3.6), the Class-B/Class-C quantum-computing predictions (4.9–4.10), and a new §5 (cosmology + gravitational-wave dynamics). Each entry carries its source paper's own tier, unmodified.

**Tiering key**, used throughout: **PASSED** (already tested, consistent) · **derived/parameter-free** (no free parameters, sharpest kind of prediction) · **structural** (form forced or identified, coefficient inherited) · **account** (coherent explanation, not a closed derivation) · **OPEN** (target pinned, computation not yet done).

| # | Prediction | Tier | Kill condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Factor-of-two light bending (deflection = 2× Newtonian) | **PASSED** (postdiction, ray-traced 2.09 vs 2.00) | A sub-Einstein or zero-bending metric |
| 1.2 | GW speed = c exactly (structural identity, one causal cone) | **PASSED** (GW170817, $\lvert c_T/c-1\rvert<10^{-15}$) | Any measured $c_{GW}\neq c$ at that precision |
| 1.3 | $a_0 = cH_0/(2\pi) \approx 1.08\times10^{-10}\,\mathrm{m/s^2}$ — MOND transition acceleration (local value; the *redshift evolution* is the flagship **1.15**) | **derived, parameter-free** (~10% match) | $a_0$ tracks $H_0$ wrong as Hubble tension resolves; wide binaries at $a_0$ obey plain Newton |
| 1.4 | BTFR slope exactly 4, zero intrinsic scatter (deep-MOND asymptote) — **plus the ED-distinctive normalization $a_0 = cH_0/(2\pi)$**. *(Softened 2026-07-14 after a SPARC confrontation: slope-4 [SPARC $V_{\rm flat}$ $3.85\pm0.09$, Lelli+2019] and near-zero scatter [$\sim$6%] are **MOND-shared** — they discriminate ED+MOND from ΛCDM [$\geq$0.15 dex expected], not ED from MOND. The one ED-distinctive claim is $a_0=cH_0/(2\pi)$: predicted $1.04$–$1.14\times10^{-10}$ vs RAR $g^\dagger=1.20\pm0.24$(sys) — consistent, $\sim$10%, but a **postdiction**. The genuine forward leg is $a_0$ **tracks** $H_0$ = prediction 4.8.)* | **derived, parameter-free** (but the sharp parts are MOND-shared; the distinctive $a_0$ match is postdictive $\sim$10%) | Slope $\neq 4$ or irreducible intrinsic scatter (SPARC — a ΛCDM-tension test, not ED-vs-MOND); the ED-vs-MOND edge is whether $a_0$ tracks $H_0$ (4.8) |
| 1.5 | $\alpha_1, \alpha_2$ (PPN preferred-frame parameters) — $\alpha_2 = 0$ exactly; $\alpha_1$ suppressed $\geq70$ orders below bound | **derived** ($\alpha_2$) **/ structural** ($\alpha_1$ suppression mechanism) | Any measured $\alpha_1 \gtrsim 10^{-5}$ or nonzero $\alpha_2$ in any sub-Planck-density environment (lunar ranging, pulsar timing) |
| 1.6 | Lensing identity — no gravitational slip beyond $O(\Phi)$, no vector field to repair it with | **structural** | A measured slip the metric-only coupling can't accommodate |
| 1.7 | Activity-dependent weak lensing — dynamically active systems show enhanced lensing vs. quiescent, same baryonic mass | **structural, PROVISIONAL** (discriminator vs. baryonic feedback still open) | No activity dependence once the discriminating observable is built |
| 1.8 | Cosmological-constant coefficient $\mathcal{W}_0 = -24\pi^2\Omega_\Lambda \approx -162$ | **OPEN** (pinned target) | Substrate integral yields wrong sign or magnitude off by $O(1)$ |
| 1.9 | $\Lambda$-smallness reframed as $(H_0/M_P)^2 \approx 10^{-122}$, not a separate fine-tuning | **structural, value inherited** (naive first-principles attempt failed by ~60 orders, on the record) | Independent evidence $\rho_\Lambda \neq (3/8\pi)H_0^2 M_P^2$ |
| 1.10 | Cluster/CMB dust sector — cosmological dial must deliver dust-like clustering at recombination through 5 independent filters | **OPEN** | No dial member satisfies all 5 filters; CMB acoustic peaks can't be fit |
| 1.11 | Scalar GW polarization (the khronon) | **structural, long-term** | Faint/near-matter signal by construction — not a present test |
| 1.12 | Universal Lorentz violation (matter and gravity share one cone) | **structural** | Measured *differential* Lorentz violation between matter species ($10^{-20}$-level bounds) |
| 1.13 | Merging-cluster offset-velocity law — mass–gas offset $\Delta r(v_{\rm rel})$ shows a **sharp knee**: flat ≈ 0 below threshold, near-linear rise above, ceiling at $\xi_{KZ}$; vs ΛCDM's uncorrelated scatter and MOND's smooth ramp | **structural** (the *shape* is the test; knee location $v_{\rm crit}\sim150$ km/s is a flagged inherited assumption, $O(3)$ class $\nu\approx0.70$, Path C) | Population-level offset–velocity relation shows ΛCDM-like scatter (no $v_{\rm rel}$ correlation) or a MOND-like gradual ramp instead of a step. **F3 (ceiling + >2-peak multiplicity) softened 2026-07-14: only *weakly* checkable now — on the 11-cluster anchor compilation (`gravity/OffsetVelocity_F3_DataTable.md`) F3 is "not contradicted, weakly" (ceiling unstressed — no system reaches $v_{\rm sat}\approx5600$ km/s; multiplicity confounded — the multi-peak systems are complex multi-way mergers, not the fastest). The sharp knee (F1/F2) is a *survey-era* test (Rubin/Euclid/eROSITA + a uniform re-measurement pipeline), not near-term.** *Source: `Paper_OffsetVelocityLaw_MergingClusterTest`.* |
| 1.14 | Group-embedded low-acceleration galaxies (DF2/DF4 regime): external-field suppression with a **knee-like transition** in kinematic enhancement vs $g_{\rm ext}/a_0$ — sharper than MOND's interpolation roll-off; suppression onset near $g_{\rm ext}\gtrsim a_0/50$ | **structural** (mechanism forced by finite outer-scale capacity; exact transition shape not yet calculated — form partially OPEN) | A group-embedded low-acceleration galaxy showing *full* deep-MOND enhancement at $g_{\rm ext}\gtrsim a_0/50$; or the transition measured smooth (MOND-like) rather than knee-like in systems at $g_{\rm ext}/a_0\sim0.1$–$0.5$. *Source: `Paper_ED_DF2_DF4_GroupSuppression`.* |
| **1.15 ⭐ FLAGSHIP** | **The MOND acceleration scale evolves with redshift as $a_0(z) = cH(z)/(2\pi)$** — a$_0$ is *not* a constant of nature (MOND) nor absent (ΛCDM); it tracks the instantaneous Hubble rate, so $a_0(z)/a_0(0) = H(z)/H_0$ (×1.3 at $z{=}0.5$, ×1.8 at $z{=}1$, ×3 at $z{=}2$). *The ED-vs-MOND weapon in the gravity sector — distinctive, parameter-free in shape, and the data are live.* | **structural / D** (composition of $a_0=cH_0/(2\pi)$ [029] + continuum-invariance [037]; `Paper_038` CO-3). **Now data-confronted (2026-07-14, addendum A10):** MUSE-DARK III (2026, A&A) detects $a_0$ evolution at **~30σ** (MOND-constant *excluded*); intercept $a_0(0)=1.0\times10^{-10}$ matches ED's $1.08$ to **8%**; inter-bin rate $a_0\propto H^{1.13}$ (ED: $\alpha{=}1$; +4% in ratio) but the linear fit reads "faster than $H(z)$" — **mildly tense, unsettled.** | The **decisive test = a direct $a_0\propto H(z)^\alpha$ fit** (MUSE-DARK + $z{\sim}0.9$–2.4 rotation curves): **$\alpha{=}1$ confirms ED distinctively; $\alpha$ clearly $\neq 1$ tensions it; $\alpha{=}0$ already excluded at ~30σ.** *Source: `Paper_038_CosmologicalImplications` CO-3 + `Paper_029`; data MUSE-DARK III A&A 2026.* |

**Tier-1 postdictions (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and Newton's $G = c^3\ell_P^2/\hbar$) are already cleared** — if any had failed, the program would already be dead.

| # | Prediction | Tier | Kill condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | Non-thermal Hawking-spectrum correction, $n_H(\omega) = n_H^{\mathrm{Planck}}(\omega)[1-c_1(\omega/\omega_c)^2+\ldots]$ — sign-definite, mass-dependent, information-bearing | **structural** (form forced; coefficient $c_1\approx1$ inherited) | Analog-Hawking spectra (BEC/fluid) come out exactly thermal, no deviation of this sign and scaling |
| 2.2 | Stable Planck-mass remnant $M_\star = \hbar/(c\ell_P) = M_P$ — evaporation halts, does not complete | **derived** at leading order (order-unity coefficient inherited) | Late-stage evaporation observed to complete to $M\to0$, or remnant at $M\neq M_P$ |
| 2.3 | Page-curve shape (rise/turnover/decline) via V5 entanglement-bandwidth cap + re-routing | **structural** (numerical scales — $t_{\mathrm{Page}}\approx0.54\tau_{BH}$ — inherited, not derived) | Continued monotonic entropy growth (no turnover); post-turnover plateau instead of decline |
| 2.4 | Extremal-horizon zero pair-emission (acoustic/BEC/EIT analog-gravity platforms) | **structural, kinematic within the acoustic-metric family** | Thermal pair-emission detected in extremal-configuration analog horizons across multiple platforms |
| 2.5 | Horizon entropy coefficient $S=A/4$ — both factors (κ's ½, the 2π) now structural via ED's own near-horizon Rindler geometry | **structural** (uses the standard Euclidean-continuation tool, same as GR) | N/A as a kill condition — this is a reproduction of a known result, not a new bet; the genuinely open, continuation-free derivation is unresolved (see `BH_Thermal2Pi` §4b) |

## 3. Matter Sector — Gauge Groups, Forces, Dimensions

*Source: `Paper_MS-II_MatterSectorFromTheArrow`. Not previously gathered into a predictions document — new to this list.*

| # | Prediction | Tier | Kill condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | No parity-violating abelian ($U(1)$) force — the abelian coupling is chirality-blind by construction | **structural** | Discovery of a chiral (parity-violating) $U(1)$ gauge force |
| 3.2 | No stable fundamental gauge group larger than $SU(3)$ — stable channel families are exactly $\{1,\ldots,d\}$ with $d=3$ | **structural** (reduces the question to one number, doesn't derive $d=3$ from nothing) | Discovery of a stable fundamental $SU(N\geq4)$ sector |
| 3.3 | Spin-½ and chirality forced by relationality/channel-topology, not merely posited | **structural** | ED shown structurally unable to carry net chirality or the spin double cover from channel structure |
| 3.4 | Substrate holds commitment-order by spatial linking $\Rightarrow$ exactly 3 spatial dimensions | **structural, one open premise** (topology rigorous; that ED uses linking specifically is not yet shown) | ED shown to hold order without spatial linking, or the linking mechanism fails in 3D |
| 3.5 | No anyons at substrate level in $D=3+1$ — only fermion/boson statistics; effective 2D *surface* anyons (FQH) are fine, as coarse-graining | **structural** (conditional on P06 + P10 + standard configuration-space topology, per the paper's own preamble) | Anyonic or parastatistical behavior in a *genuine* 3+1D system (not a 2+1D surface state). *Source: `Paper_104_AnyonProhibition`, `Paper_102` F2.* |
| 3.6 | Spin–statistics dichotomy $\eta=(-1)^{2s}$ substrate-derived (P09 $U(1)$ polarity + P06 3+1D exchange topology) | **structural** (conditional on inherited QFT exchange machinery, per `Paper_102` preamble) | Integer-spin particle with fermionic behavior, or half-integer-spin with bosonic, in 3+1D without intervening interactions. *Source: `Paper_102_SpinStatistics` F1.* |

*Source: `Paper_ED_Predictions_Bundle.md` §§6–11; `Paper_056_ClassA_Wall`.*

| # | Prediction | Tier | Kill condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | Quantum-to-classical Class-A multiplicity wall, matter-wave interferometry: sharp, architecture-independent decoherence boundary extrapolated to **140–250 kDa** | **structural** (the wall's existence/sharpness is the load-bearing claim; the specific mass is an anchored extrapolation, not a derivation) | Matter-wave interference succeeds cleanly at $\geq250$ kDa with no wall; or no sharp wall at any mass (would falsify the structural claim, not just the number) |
| 4.2 | Secondary signature: second-harmonic interference content (3–6%) in fringe residuals near the Q-C crossing | **structural** | Pure first-harmonic decay observed near the crossing, standard decoherence's prediction |
| 4.3 | Universal Degenerate-Mobility law, $D(c)=D_0(1-c/c_{\max})^\beta$ | **PASSED** (peer-reviewed, 10 materials, $R^2>0.986$, May 2026) | A material in-class with $R^2<0.8$ |
| 4.4 | FRAP front-radius exponent $\alpha_R = 1/6$ in concentrated BSA (independent second confirmation of 4.3 via a different observable) | **structural** (protocol-ready, ~$500–1500, 6–8 weeks) | $\alpha_R \geq 0.35$ or Fickian front wins at all concentrations |
| 4.5 | AFM dewetting cross-scale invariance, $\mathrm{med}(\mathcal{R}_{\mathrm{motif}})=-1.30$ | **structural** (session-ready, ~$500–15K) | Median outside $[-1.80,-0.90]$ |
| 4.6 | Slow envelope modulation at bifurcation ($f_v\approx1.1\gamma_{\mathrm{dec}}$, the $Q/\pi$ form; **corrected 2026-07-10 from a stale $8\gamma_{\mathrm{dec}}$** — see `ED-09-5-Envelope_InProcess/protocol.md`; band moved to ~11–110 Hz; universality still rests on an assumed-universal $Q\approx3.5$), tested across 10+ orders of magnitude in decoherence rate (optomechanics + FRAP residuals) | **structural** (FRAP-residual track is $0-cost, ~1 week, self-contained) | No envelope detected at predicted frequency band in any of 3+ uncorrelated datasets |
| 4.7 | GW merger-lag existence (dynamical delay vs. standard-relativistic merger time) | **structural, PROVISIONAL** (only existence, not the floor value, is refutation-grade yet) | (Not yet refutation-grade until the substrate-anchored floor $\tau_{V_5}^{\min}$ is derived) |
| 4.8 | SCBU synchronized covariation — six independent projections of the substrate-cosmology boundary must co-vary under Hubble-tension-class $H_0$ shifts | **structural** | Asynchrony between any two projections (e.g. $a_0$ tracks $H_0$ but another projection stays flat) |
| 4.9 | Class-B quantum platforms (topological/rigidity protection): error suppression **exponential** in the rigidity parameter, $e^{-\xi/\xi_0}$ — not polynomial, not constant — with the same form across architectures (Majorana, surface codes, anyonic) | **structural** (form forced conditional on the paper's declared P-Rigidity-Gap postulate; $\xi_0$ values inherited) | A lever-B platform showing non-exponential (polynomial, constant, super-exponential) suppression. *Source: `Paper_057_ClassB_GapSuppression`.* |
| 4.10 | Class-C quantum platforms: error suppression **plateaus** at $\Gamma_{\rm plateau}>0$ — **re-scoped 2026-07-14 to broadcast-type redundancy** (repetition-type codes, GHZ/cat-type encodings). $\alpha_{\rm topological}=0$: topological codes load loci O(1) in distance, so the mechanism never binds there and ED predicts **no substrate plateau in surface-code distance** (matches Willow's clean $\Lambda\approx2$ suppression). The two active legs: (a) persistence of the repetition-code error floor (Google d≤29: apparent $10^{-10}$ floor above d≈15 — watch item, mundane burst attribution live; discriminator = floor survives shielding + sits at cross-platform-consistent converted content); (b) the certified cat-state width ceiling, same budget at fixed ratio | **structural** (plateau form conditional on P-Corr-Budget; domain settlement D-structural; scales inherited) | A pure broadcast-type platform showing continued exponential suppression at arbitrarily high redundancy *after burst mitigation*; or post-mitigation floors at inconsistent converted content across platforms. *(Topological-distance suppression no longer bears on this prediction.)* *Source: `Paper_058_ClassC_Plateau` + `Paper_058b_PlateauDomain_AlphaTopological` + `Paper_QuantumDarwinism_RecordBandwidth`.* |

| # | Prediction | Tier | Kill condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5.1 | Dark energy: **strict $w=-1$ exactly**, no time variation ($\dot w = 0$) — saturation regime, not a quintessence/phantom field | **structural** (D-via-I chain per Cos_05; distinguishes ED from dynamical dark energy) | Robust measurement of $w \neq -1$ or $\dot w \neq 0$ (any confirmed quintessence- or phantom-like evolution) |
| 5.2 | Cosmological equation-of-state values confined to the substrate-admitted set $\{-1, 0, 1/3\}$ (and additive composites) | **structural** (chain-class identifications OPEN at substrate level, per Dyn_02's own audit — the *set* is the claim) | A clean phantom $w<-1$ epoch or stiff $w=1$ epoch that mixed-substrate composition cannot absorb |
| 5.3 | Tensor consistency relation $n_T = -r/8$ | **structural, inherited** — **not ED-distinctive** (Cos_06's own flag: tests the inherited standard-inflation framework) | Joint $r$ + $n_T$ measurements (Simons Observatory, CMB-S4, LiteBIRD) violating the slow-roll consistency relation |
| 5.4 | Radiation selection rules: **no monopole or dipole gravitational radiation; no scalar/longitudinal EM radiation** — two transverse modes each | **structural** (inheritance-composition row; Dyn_03's F1 sharpness rests on it) | Detection of monopole/dipole GW or scalar/longitudinal EM radiation modes (LIGO/Virgo polarization-content analyses currently consistent). *Consistency watch: 1.11 predicts a faint khronon scalar GW mode; these coexist only while that mode stays faint/suppressed — flagged, not resolved.* |
| 5.5 | Black-hole ringdown: mode frequencies scale $\omega \sim 1/M$ at leading order; damping rates $\sim 1/\tau_{V_5}^{\rm eff}$ | **structural** (QNM machinery inherited; scales substrate-parameter-inherited) | High-SNR ringdown (ET/CE era) deviating from $\omega\sim1/M$ scaling, or significantly longer-lived ringdown than the V5 finite-memory prediction allows |
| 5.6 | Stochastic GW background: inspiral-band slope $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)\propto f^{2/3}$ | **structural** (M2-conditional per GW_02; the NANOGrav 2023 nHz signal matches under the SMBH-inspiral interpretation — a *model-degenerate postdiction*, tiered as such, not a confirmation) | $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)$ spectrum systematically inconsistent with the per-event composition in inspiral-dominated bands |

## 6. Reading This List: Where to Start

**⭐ FLAGSHIP forward test (added 2026-07-14) — 1.15, the redshift evolution of $a_0$.** ED predicts $a_0(z)=cH(z)/(2\pi)$: the MOND acceleration scale is not a constant (MOND) but tracks the Hubble rate, growing ×1.8 by $z{=}1$, ×3 by $z{=}2$. This is the corpus's sharpest *live, data-confronted, ED-vs-MOND* prediction — MUSE-DARK III (2026) already detects $a_0$ evolution at ~30σ (killing MOND-constant), matches ED's local value to 8%, and sits right on the edge of ED's $H(z)$ rate. The decisive number is $\alpha$ in $a_0\propto H(z)^\alpha$ (ED: 1; MOND: 0, excluded). *This is the near-term prediction most likely to single ED out.*

**Already decided (postdictions, Tier 1/PASSED):** if these had gone wrong, the program would be dead already. They're the floor, not the pitch.

**Sharpest, cheapest, most active right now:** 1.3 ($a_0$, live wide-binary controversy), 1.5 (PPN — friendliest to send, already inside current bounds), 2.1 (non-thermal Hawking — genuine open question to an active lab, not a contested claim), 4.3/4.4 (already passed / cheap to extend). *(1.13's F3 leg removed from this bucket 2026-07-14 — it is only weakly checkable now; see below.)*

**Strong consilience ED passes (not an ED-vs-MOND weapon):** 1.4 (BTFR slope-4 + zero scatter — *softened 2026-07-14*: the sharp parts are MOND-shared and only challenge ΛCDM; ED's distinctive $a_0=cH_0/(2\pi)$ is a $\sim$10% postdiction. The forward ED-vs-MOND edge is $a_0$-tracks-$H_0$, 4.8, which is harder). Kept for the ΛCDM-tension value, demoted from "highest-payoff weapon."

**Quietly the most distinctive:** 4.6 (the envelope prediction spans 10+ orders of magnitude in decoherence rate with one formula — no phenomenological-fit account does that), 3.1/3.2 (matter-sector predictions nobody else in the corpus's competing frameworks makes at all), 4.10 (the Class-C plateau, re-scoped to broadcast-type redundancy — standard fault-tolerance predicts errors going to zero; ED predicts a floor, and Google's repetition-code data already shows the shape, with the burst-mitigation campaign as the live test), and 1.13/1.14 (the two *knees* — both are sharp-transition-vs-smooth-roll-off discriminators against MOND and ΛCDM, one at cluster scale, one at group scale; *note 2026-07-14: 1.13's sharp knee is survey-era, its F3 leg only weakly checkable now — distinctive in principle, not near-term in practice*).

**Not yet a bet, still homework:** 1.8, 1.10 (open numbers with pinned targets, no computation yet), 3.4 (the linking premise, not yet shown), 4.7 (real but not refutation-grade until a floor value exists), 1.14's exact transition shape (knee expected, form not yet calculated).
