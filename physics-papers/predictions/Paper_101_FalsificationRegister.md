## Preamble: What This Paper Does NOT Claim

1. **The 13 primitives are not derived** (Paper_087).
2. **No claim that the falsification register is exhaustive across the full corpus.** As of the date written, the register integrates falsifier sentences from all Wave-2 papers in the current corpus (28 + recent 10 = 38 papers). Future papers will add to the register.
3. **No claim of empirical predictions beyond what's in upstream papers.** This paper is a **cross-corpus integration document**; predictions originate in the respective papers (per their Falsification Criteria sections).
4. **No claim of empirical resolution of any pending observation.** The register documents falsifier sentences; whether they are empirically tested is downstream-of-this-paper experimental program work.
5. **No claim of derivability between falsifiers.** Some falsifiers may be redundant (one implies another); the register catalogues all without attempting reduction.

## Abstract

This paper supplies the **corpus capstone**: a unified **falsification register + prediction inventory** integrating per-paper falsifier sentences from all Wave-2 papers in the current corpus. The register is organized by arc:

- **QM-kinematics** (Papers_001, 002, 003, 004, 005, 006, 007).
- **QFT** (Papers_015, 016, 017, 018).
- **Gravity** (Papers_025, 026, 027, 028, 029, 030, 031, 032, 033).
- **BH/Hawking** (Papers_039, 047, 050, 052).
- **Q-COMPUTE** (Papers_054, 056, 057, 058).
- **Entanglement** (Papers_063, 064).
- **Soft-matter** (Papers_073, 074).
- **Wedges / kernel arc / foundations** (Papers_087, 088, 089, 090, 093).

For each arc, the register catalogues:

- **Per-paper falsifier sentences** (direct cross-reference).
- **Empirical predictions** with current status (testable / partially-tested / awaiting tests).
- **Cross-domain testability map** — which empirical regimes test which arcs.

The register is the **operational guide** for the ED empirical-test program. The paper makes no claim of exhaustivity across future papers, no claim of empirical-test resolution, and no claim of falsifier-redundancy reduction.

## 0. Sharpened Update 2026-07-10 — the weapons-first inventory

*The §3 register and §5 priorities below were written 2026-05-13 (38 papers) and are STALE: they predate the gravity-keystone closure (GR-I..IV, KM-I/II), the whole chiral-gauge / matter sector, the Gleason reconstruction, and the scale-correspondence program. The current superset enumeration is `ED_Master_Predictions_List.md` (updated 2026-07-05, entries 1.1–5.6). This section adds what neither doc had: a **ranked separation of the genuinely novel, sharp, near-term "weapons" from the postdictions and internal-consistency checks** — the distinction that actually matters for the goal (a confirmed, novel, falsifiable prediction that ends arguments). Every value-layer number here is INHERITED (per Paper_095); it is the **form/sign/shape** that is forced and failable.*

### 0.1 What counts as a weapon
A weapon is **novel** (standard physics does not make the claim), **sharp** (a number, sign, or shape — not a direction), **near-term testable**, and **distinctive** (ED and ΛCDM / standard QM / GR diverge *at a measurable point*). A postdiction (reproducing a known value) is *consilience* — supporting, never argument-ending — and is kept in a separate column. An internal-consistency check (does ED's own PDE map to a circuit) is not an empirical discriminator at all.

### 0.2 Tier-1 — ED's sharpest falsifiable bets (ranked)

| # | Prediction (source) | ED signature | Standard physics predicts instead | Test / timeframe | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Participation-envelope modulation** (Bundle §10 / ML 4.6) | one universal ratio `ω_v ≈ 8·γ_dec` (N_osc≈1.3), same across 10+ orders of magnitude in decoherence rate | no theory predicts a universal ratio spanning optomechanics→FRAP; decoherence is monotonic, no slow envelope | FRAP Lomb–Scargle **Track B ≈ $0, ~1 week** on existing data; optomechanics Track A (~16 mHz) | **cheapest new result in the corpus; run first** |
| 2 | **Merging-cluster offset–velocity KNEE** (OffsetVelocityLaw; ML 1.13) + **group-embedded DF2/DF4 knee** (ML 1.14) | sharp *step-like* knee: flat → knee → linear → ceiling; fast mergers show >2 lensing peaks | ΛCDM → velocity-*independent* scatter (no knee); MOND → *smooth* roll-off (no knee) | ceiling + >2-peak leg testable **now** on El Gordo-class mergers; full knee = Rubin/Euclid | **experiment-ready** (shape robust; knee *location* inherited) |
| 3 | **Class-A decoherence wall** (Paper_056; ML 4.1–4.2) | sharp architecture-*independent* mass wall at 140–250 kDa + 3–6% second-harmonic fringe near crossing | smooth, environment/architecture-dependent decoherence; no universal wall | matter-wave interferometry (Arndt/Vienna, LUMI); now at ~25 kDa | pre-registered; 5–10 yr (the **form** is the claim; kDa value is anchored extrapolation) |
| 4 | **Class-C error-correction plateau** (Paper_058; ML 4.10) + **Class-B exponential rigidity** (4.9) | logical error floors at `Γ_plateau > 0`; Class-B suppression `∝ e^{−ξ/ξ₀}` | fault tolerance → error → 0 exponentially with code distance | surface-code / topological-qubit scaling — **industry is climbing code distance now** | near-term; a test arriving *for free* |
| 5 | **BTFR zero intrinsic scatter** (Paper_031; ML 1.4) | *exactly zero* intrinsic scatter in the deep-MOND asymptote (the slope-4 is a postdiction; the zero-scatter is the bet) | ΛCDM halo models → nonzero scatter from formation-history variance | SPARC public data, improving precision | consistent so far; **the cleanest single number to miss** |
| 6 | **Dark energy strict `w=−1, ẇ=0`** (ML 5.1) | saturation, not quintessence — `w` pinned to −1, no evolution | quintessence/phantom allow `w≠−1`, `w_a≠0` | DESI / Euclid `w₀–w_a` | **live** — if DESI evolution firms up, a near-term kill (a real risk = a real weapon) |
| 7 | **Non-thermal Hawking correction** (Paper_047; ML 2.1) + **Planck-mass remnant** (2.2) | sign-definite `n_H[1 − c₁(ω/ω_c)²]`; evaporation halts at `M_⋆ = M_P` | exact thermal spectrum; complete evaporation | analog gravity (BEC/EIT/optical) | near-term in labs (`c₁~O(1)` inherited; conditional on P-V5-Even) |
| 8 | **PPN `α₂ = 0` exactly** (GR-IV; ML 1.5) | `α₂` identically zero (both cones luminal); `α₁` nonzero but ≥70 orders below bound | generic khronometric / Lorentz-violating class → `α₂ ~ O(1)` (GR also = 0) | LLR, pulsar timing, `|α₂|<10⁻⁷` | inside bounds — a clean **kill-switch ED passes** (not a positive vs GR) |
| 9 | **Matter-sector prohibitions** (ML 3.1/3.2/3.5) | no parity-violating (chiral) `U(1)` force; no stable gauge group beyond `SU(3)`; no anyons in genuine 3+1D | general gauge theory allows all three | any counterexample = one-line kill | standing prohibitions; distinctive (competitors don't make these) |
| 10 | **FRAP `α_R = 1/6`** (ML 4.4) + **AFM dewetting invariant −1.30** (4.5) | porous-medium front `R∼t^{1/6}`, not Fickian `t^{1/2}`; motif-ratio median −1.30 | Fickian diffusion `t^{1/2}`; no invariant | benchtop, ~$500–1500, weeks | protocol-ready; independent re-confirmations of the (peer-reviewed) UDM law |

### 0.3 The postdiction column — consilience, NOT weapons (keep separate)
Reproductions of already-known values; supporting evidence, but they cannot end an argument and several are shared with ΛCDM/MOND/GR: **`a₀ = cH₀/2π`** (value known since 1983; only its *co-tracking of H₀* is a forward leg), **BTFR slope-4** (data `3.95±0.08` predates the paper), **Λ-smallness `Θ_ED≈10⁻¹²²`** (inherited + reframing; the naive first-principles attempt failed by ~60 orders), **`S=A/4`**, **`c_GW=c`** (structurally *inherited* — a survival, not a risked bet), **`n_T=−r/8`** (tests standard inflation), **spin-statistics `(−1)^{2s}`**, **stochastic GW `Ω∝f^{2/3}`** (self-labeled "model-degenerate postdiction"). Internal-consistency checks (e.g. the RLC-circuit isomorphism) are not empirical discriminators at all.

### 0.4 Genuinely confirmed so far (the floor)
- **Universal Degenerate-Mobility law** `D(c)=D₀(1−c/c_max)^β` — peer-reviewed May 2026, 10 materials, `R²>0.986`. The corpus's one genuine *confirmed forward* prediction.
- **`c_GW=c`** (GW170817, `<10⁻¹⁵`) — a survival that killed many rival modified-gravity theories; ED inherits it structurally, so it is consilience, not a distinctive win.

### 0.5 Distinctive but NOT yet weapons (honest flags)
- **Primitive einselection / emergent multi-context** (the 2026-07-08 Gleason reconstruction, Gate 1): genuinely distinctive claims (the arrow selects the pointer basis fundamentally; Gleason/KS multi-context is emergent), but the source doc states plainly they have **no concrete near-term observable** — a falsifier frontier, not a weapon yet.
- **Gauge-handedness ↔ cosmic-matter-sign correlation** (#2b): **retired to a wall.** The July hardening (ParityWall) makes ED's fermion vector-by-default and weak parity violation *inherited*; the "one lock imprints both C and P" correlation is superseded and flagged "not testable with current data." Do not list as a positive prediction.
- **Honest note on the recent foundational work:** Gate 1 (QM-foundations reconstruction) and Gate 2 (chiral gauge) closed structure and mapped walls but produced **no new near-term weapon**. The highest-leverage move toward the goal is therefore **executing the Tier-1 bets above — especially the two that could yield a new result with no new funding (#1 envelope Track B; #2 cluster-knee ceiling leg on existing mergers)** — not further derivation.

### 0.6 Where these are being tested (active experiments)
The in-process experiment folders (`predictions/*_InProcess/`) already hold protocols for several Tier-1 bets: the participation envelope (`ED-09-5-Envelope_InProcess`), FRAP mobility (`FRAP-High-BSA_InProcess`), analog-Hawking (`ED-Acoustic-*_InProcess`), AFM dewetting, QC mass extrapolation, triad coupling, and the RLC analogue. Growing this from protocols to *run results* on bets #1, #2, #4 is the operational north-star path.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 What this paper does

This paper integrates the per-paper falsification criteria sections from all Wave-2 papers in the current corpus into a single **falsification register + prediction inventory**. **Like Paper_088 (Primitive Load-Bearing Audit), this paper integrates existing content rather than introducing new substrate-level commitments.** The §3 register cross-references the per-paper Falsification Criteria sections; the §4 testability map and §5 operational guide are position-level commitments about cross-domain testability and program priorities. The register serves three functions:

1. **Single-document falsifier reference** — every Wave-2 paper's Falsification Criteria section condensed into one place for cross-corpus access.
2. **Cross-domain testability map** — which empirical regimes test which papers' substrate-level commitments.
3. **Operational guide for empirical-test program** — identifies near-term vs. long-term testability across arcs.

### 1.2 Arc context

- **Paper_088:** Primitive Load-Bearing Audit (per-primitive load-bearing across corpus).
- **Paper_101 (this paper):** Falsification Register and Prediction Inventory (per-falsifier across corpus).

Papers_088 + 101 together constitute the corpus-level audit machinery: 088 maps **primitives → load-bearing roles**; 101 maps **predictions → falsifier sentences**.

## 2. Primitive Inputs

**This paper's inputs are the falsifier sentences from the Wave-2 corpus.** No new substrate-level commitments are introduced.

**Paper-specific postulates introduced:** **None.** This paper integrates existing per-paper content into a single corpus-level register; it does not introduce new substrate-level commitments. (Preserved from §8.5 of prior round before §8 deletion.)

**Upstream paper dependencies:** All Wave-2 papers in the current corpus (38 as of date written).

| Step | Status | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 13 primitives postulated | P | Paper_087 |
| Per-paper falsifier sentences exist | I | All Wave-2 papers' Falsification Criteria sections |
| Integration into single document | **I+D mixed** | §3 — **I** for per-paper falsifier content (inherited from each Wave-2 paper's Falsification Criteria section), **D** for catalogue organization (this paper's structural contribution: organizing by arc, adding testability map). *(Round-8 clarification of mixed status.)* |
| Cross-domain testability map | **P (position)** | §4 substrate-level position commitment about cross-domain testability |
| Empirical-test program operational guide | A→position | §5 substrate-level position commitment |

All rows P, D, I, or labeled. **No A (asserted) rows.**

## 5. Operational Empirical-Test Program

### 5.1 Near-term highest-leverage tests

1. **Matter-wave interferometry at 50+ kDa** (Class-A wall test) — testable in 5–10 years per Paper_056.
2. **Analog Hawking experiments** (non-thermal correction test) — already testable; resolution of $(\omega/\omega_c)^2$ requires improved sensitivity.
3. **Hubble tension resolution** — concurrent with cosmology program; near-term.
4. **Galaxy-catalog BTFR scatter** — gradual improvement over decades; near-term refinement possible.

### 5.2 Cross-domain coherence checks

The substrate framework's wedge claim is **cross-domain reach** (Paper_087 §6.4 position commitment): same primitives generate mechanisms across QM/QFT/BH/gravity/Q-COMPUTE/entanglement/soft-matter. Cross-domain coherence falsification (Paper_087 §9.2) requires:

- Empirical confirmation of substrate-level commitments in some arcs.
- Empirical refutation of substrate-level commitments in others.
- Pattern inconsistent with a single substrate framework.

**No such pattern currently exists.** All empirical content currently consistent with substrate framework at structural-form level (with value-layer inputs); specific predictions (Class-A wall, $(\omega/\omega_c)^2$, etc.) are not yet tested at resolved precision.

### 5.3 Prediction prioritization

**Highest-confidence ED predictions:**

1. **Class-A multiplicity wall** at 140–250 kDa (Paper_056 — extrapolation, structural form sharp).
2. **Non-thermal $(\omega/\omega_c)^2$ Hawking corrections** (Paper_047 — structural form derived under P-V5-Even).
3. **Slope-4 BTFR with zero intrinsic scatter** in deep-MOND asymptotic (Paper_031 — structural form derived).
4. **Class-C plateau at high redundancy** (Paper_058 — structural form derived under P-Corr-Budget).
5. **$a_0 = cH_0/(2\pi)$ within Hubble-tension range** (Paper_029 — structural form + numerical ~10% match).

These five are the **substrate framework's empirical signatures**; collective confirmation/refutation across them would substantially shift the framework's empirical status.

## 6. Falsification Criteria for This Paper

### 6.1 Register incompleteness

**Falsifier sentence:** *Demonstration that significant falsifier sentences from existing Wave-2 papers are missing from this register — would falsify the register's coverage claim.*

### 6.2 Cross-domain testability map incorrect

**Falsifier sentence:** *Empirical demonstration that the cross-domain testability map (§4) mis-identifies which empirical regimes test which arcs — would force revision of the operational guide.*

### 6.3 Empirical content already exists

**Falsifier sentence:** *Identification of existing empirical observations that already test (and confirm or refute) any of the prediction-inventory items at the structural-form level — would move that prediction from "awaiting tests" to "tested" with the corresponding empirical outcome.*

## 7. Position Statement

**The corpus capstone:** falsifier sentences and predictions from all Wave-2 papers integrated into a single document, organized by arc, with cross-domain testability map and operational empirical-test program guide.

What this paper claims:

- Integration is comprehensive across Wave-2 corpus as of date written.
- Cross-domain testability map is operational guide.
- Five highest-confidence predictions identified for empirical priority.

What this paper does *not* claim:

- Falsifiers are not new content; cross-referenced from upstream papers.
- Empirical-test resolution is not delivered; experimental work is downstream.
- Register is not exhaustive of future-paper additions.

**Series context.** Paper_101 of wedges / corpus capstone. **Cross-corpus integration.**
