## §1 Introduction

The Universal Degenerate-Mobility (UDM) law derived from the Event Density (ED) substrate framework predicts a universal concentration-dependent diffusion functional form:

$$
D(c) = D_0 \left(1 - \frac{c}{c_{\max}}\right)^\beta
$$

with canonical $\beta \approx 2$. The functional form is **derived from substrate primitives** (ED Canon principle P4 — Mobility Capacity Bound) prior to any data fitting. The Universal Mobility Law Evidence paper (peer-reviewed, May 2026) confirmed this functional form across **10 materials** spanning soft-matter / biological systems with $R^2 > 0.986$ at all materials. This established UDM as the corpus's first peer-reviewed external-validation-achieved result.

This paper reports the FRAP-BSA experimental test of UDM via an independent observable: **front-radius propagation exponent** in fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. The 2D porous-medium equation (PME) with $m = \beta + 1 = 3$ derived from UDM with $\beta = 2$ gives front-radius exponent:

$$
\alpha_R = \frac{1}{d(m-1) + 2} = \frac{1}{6} \approx 0.167.
$$

ED predicts $R(t) \sim t^{1/6}$ with a **sharp** bleach boundary (compact support, PME signature). The null prediction (standard Fickian diffusion) is $R(t) \sim t^{1/2}$ with a Gaussian-blurred boundary.

The FRAP-BSA test is an **independent second confirmation** of UDM via a *different observable* (front propagation rather than diffusion-coefficient regression). A PASS here complements the existing peer-reviewed Universal Mobility Law evidence without replacing it; a FAIL would create tension with the published 10-material match and require resolution.

## §2 Theory

### §2.1 The UDM mobility channel (ED Canon P4)

The ED PDE framework posits the substrate-level mobility-capacity bound (Canon P4): substrate-level mobility $M(\rho)$ vanishes as the substrate event-density $\rho$ approaches its maximum $\rho_{\max}$:

$$
M(\rho) = M_0 \left(\rho_{\max} - \rho\right)^\beta.
$$

Canonical $\beta = 2$. This is structural per ED Canon P4; the functional form is form-FORCED from substrate primitives prior to any empirical data.

### §2.2 Connection to concentration-dependent diffusion

The diffusion coefficient $D(c) = M(c) \cdot \chi^{-1}(c)$, where $\chi(c) = dc/d\mu$ is the susceptibility. For concentration-dependent diffusion in the UDM regime, $D(c) = D_0(1 - c/c_{\max})^\beta$ — the form confirmed in the peer-reviewed Universal Mobility Law paper across 10 materials.

### §2.3 Connection to the 2D porous-medium equation

For 2D radial spreading (FRAP geometry), the UDM mobility channel produces the 2D porous-medium equation (PME):

$$
\frac{\partial c}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot \left[D_0 (1 - c/c_{\max})^\beta \nabla c\right] = \nabla \cdot \left[D_{\mathrm{eff}}(c) \nabla c\right]
$$

with effective diffusion $D_{\mathrm{eff}}(c) \propto (1 - c/c_{\max})^\beta$. This PME admits Barenblatt-type self-similar solutions with **compact support** (sharp front boundary) and front-radius scaling:

$$
R(t) \sim t^{\alpha_R}, \quad \alpha_R = \frac{1}{d(m-1) + 2}
$$

with $m = \beta + 1$ and $d = 2$ (2D FRAP geometry). For $\beta = 2$: $m = 3$, $\alpha_R = 1/6 \approx 0.167$.

### §2.4 ED prediction (form-FORCED) vs Fickian null (form-FORCED)

**ED-UDM prediction.**
- $R(t) \sim t^{1/6} \approx t^{0.167}$
- Sharp bleach boundary (PME compact support; characteristic of porous-medium-class diffusion)
- $R(t)$ slope on log-log plot: $0.167 \pm 0.04$ (allowing for finite-sample fit uncertainty)

**Fickian null prediction.**
- $R(t) \sim t^{1/2} \approx t^{0.500}$
- Gaussian-blurred boundary (Fickian / heat-equation signature)
- $R(t)$ slope on log-log plot: $0.500 \pm$ (fit uncertainty)

**Discrimination.** The two predictions differ in $\alpha_R$ by a factor of 3 — well outside any reasonable observational uncertainty in a properly-designed FRAP experiment. PME vs Fickian fit can be discriminated by AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) at standard observational precision.

## §4 Expected results

### §4.1 ED-UDM prediction (PASS scenario)

If UDM holds for concentrated BSA:

| Concentration | Expected $\alpha_R$ | Expected front character |
|---|---|---|
| 200 mg/mL | $0.167 \pm 0.04$ | Sharp |
| 250 mg/mL | $0.167 \pm 0.04$ | Sharp |
| 300 mg/mL | $0.167 \pm 0.04$ | Sharp |
| 350 mg/mL | $0.167 \pm 0.04$ | Sharp |

**PASS criterion.** $\alpha_R \in [0.125, 0.170]$ at $\geq 3/4$ concentrations + PME-front fit beats Fickian-front fit via AIC ($\Delta\mathrm{AIC} > 4$ in favor of PME).

### §4.2 Fickian null prediction (FAIL-of-ED scenario)

If standard Fickian diffusion holds:

| Concentration | Expected $\alpha_R$ | Expected front character |
|---|---|---|
| 200 mg/mL | $0.500 \pm 0.05$ | Gaussian-blurred |
| 250 mg/mL | $0.500 \pm 0.05$ | Gaussian-blurred |
| 300 mg/mL | $0.500 \pm 0.05$ | Gaussian-blurred |
| 350 mg/mL | $0.500 \pm 0.05$ | Gaussian-blurred |

**FAIL-of-ED criterion.** $\alpha_R \geq 0.35$ or Fickian-front fit wins via AIC at all 4 concentrations.

### §4.3 Mixed / intermediate outcomes

Five-outcome decision tree (per protocol §10):

- **PASS** — ED-UDM confirmed (criterion §4.1)
- **NEAR-PASS** — $\alpha_R$ within $[0.125, 0.170]$ at $\geq 2/4$ concentrations but not $\geq 3/4$; or PME fit beats Fickian by $\Delta\mathrm{AIC} \in (2, 4]$ rather than $> 4$
- **FAIL** — Fickian wins per §4.2
- **UNDECIDABLE** — $\alpha_R \in [0.17, 0.35]$ across concentrations; AIC $|\Delta\mathrm{AIC}| < 2$
- **SPLIT** — different concentrations give different outcomes (e.g., PASS at high concentration, Fickian at low concentration) — would suggest UDM is an asymptotic-high-concentration regime, requiring substrate-research-frontier follow-on

## §5 Data analysis pipeline

### §5.1 Front-radius extraction

[Implementation: `analysis/scripts/udm_frap/frap_udm_pipeline.py` per protocol §9.4]

1. **Frame registration.** Cross-correlation alignment against pre-bleach frame to correct stage drift.
2. **Background subtraction.** Per-frame uniform background from off-bleach ROI.
3. **Front detection.** For each post-bleach frame:
   - Radial profile $I(r, t)$ from ROI center
   - Front position $R(t)$ = radius at which $I(r, t) = 0.5 \cdot (I_{\mathrm{pre-bleach}} - I_{\mathrm{bleach center}}) + I_{\mathrm{bleach center}}$ (50%-recovery isoline)
4. **Front-character quantification.** Sharp-boundary metric: $|dI/dr|_{\max}$ at front; Gaussian-fit residual character.

### §5.2 $\alpha_R$ regression

5. **Log-log fit.** Linear regression of $\log R(t)$ vs $\log t$ over the front-propagation regime ($t \in [1, 30]$ s post-bleach). Extract $\alpha_R$ + standard error.
6. **Per-concentration $\alpha_R$ aggregation.** 5 bleaches per concentration → 5 $\alpha_R$ values per concentration → mean $\bar\alpha_R$ + standard deviation.

### §5.3 PME vs Fickian model fit

7. **PME fit.** Numerical solution of 2D PME $\partial c/\partial t = \nabla \cdot [D_0(1-c/c_{\max})^\beta \nabla c]$ with $\beta = 2$. Two free parameters per acquisition: $D_0$ and $c_{\max}$. Least-squares fit to $I(r, t)$ data.
8. **Fickian fit.** Numerical solution of 2D heat equation $\partial c/\partial t = D \nabla^2 c$. One free parameter per acquisition: $D$. Least-squares fit to $I(r, t)$ data.
9. **AIC comparison.** $\mathrm{AIC}_{\mathrm{PME}} = 2 \cdot 2 - 2 \ln L_{\mathrm{PME}}$ vs $\mathrm{AIC}_{\mathrm{Fickian}} = 2 \cdot 1 - 2 \ln L_{\mathrm{Fickian}}$. $\Delta\mathrm{AIC} = \mathrm{AIC}_{\mathrm{Fickian}} - \mathrm{AIC}_{\mathrm{PME}}$ favors PME if positive.

### §5.4 Per-concentration and ensemble decision

10. **Per-concentration outcome.** Apply 5-outcome decision tree (§4.3) using $\bar\alpha_R$ + $\Delta\mathrm{AIC}$ at each concentration.
11. **Ensemble decision.** PASS if 3/4 concentrations PASS individually; otherwise per the 5-outcome tree.
