# QFT — Folder Guide *(fields, gauge, Yang-Mills, the matter sector)*

**What this folder is.** The field-theory sector: how quantum field theory, gauge fields, and the Standard-Model-facing matter structure emerge from the substrate. Free scalar QFT as the continuum limit of the V1 kernel; gauge fields as rule-type bundles; the Yang-Mills arc (non-abelian generalization → OS positivity → the mass-gap mechanism → Clay relevance); open-system dynamics (Lindblad from V5); and the matter sector (**MS-I / MS-II**: gauge groups from channel multiplicity, the spinor, chirality from the arrow, and the three-generation/dimension count).

**State** *(authoritative source: `event-density/docs/ED_Research_Targets.md`, targets #2b + the YM notes; PAPERS_INDEX)*:
- **QFT emergence + gauge structure are grounded** — free scalar QFT (017), gauge-as-bundles (015/T17), minimal coupling (016).
- **Yang-Mills:** the substrate mechanisms are structural (018–022); the **mass-gap has a verified structural core** (non-abelian `[A,A]` lifts the abelian flat direction) but **continuum survival is the Clay-hard wall** — Open. (023 is the Clay-relevance synthesis, not a claim of proof.)
- **The matter sector is the open research frontier (#2b)** — MS-I/MS-II assemble what ED's substrate carries (gauge groups from multiplicity, parity from the non-abelian sector, the spinor), but the Standard-Model completion (why chirality, the `{1,2,3}` multiplicities, anomaly cancellation) reduces to the **T4 spinor gate** and is *not closed*. This is the highest-leverage open item in the whole program.
- **Values inherited:** platform-specific Chern numbers (015.5), and coupling constants generally.

**Tier key:** `Derived` (from primitives) · `Grounded` (conditional/structural) · `Reference` (canonical kernel form) · `Synthesis` (arc overview) · `Inherited` (a value from measurement) · `Open` (the declared frontier — YM continuum, and #2b matter completion).
