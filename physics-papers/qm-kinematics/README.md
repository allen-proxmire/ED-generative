# QM-Kinematics — Folder Guide

**What this folder is.** The Phase-1 program: **quantum mechanics emerges from the substrate primitives.** The four QM postulates (state space, composition, the Born rule, measurement, unitary evolution) and the core quantum phenomena (interference, Berry/Aharonov-Bohm phases, Bloch, Heisenberg, the momentum operator) are derived — or grounded with a named inherited value — from the 13 primitives (Paper_087), with no quantum structure assumed at the start.

**State of the arc** *(authoritative source: `event-density/docs/ED_Research_Targets.md`, target #8b; PAPERS_INDEX Arc 1)*:
- **The QM-emergence arc is CLOSED** — the four postulates and the standard phenomena are substrate-derived (a 16-theorem program).
- **The one open residual is the inner product / Gleason step** (Paper_004, Paper_007): the sesquilinear form is grounded *conditional on* two added postulates (P-Channel-Orthogonality, P-Gleason-Compatibility). Recent work (#8b) partially derived P-Gleason-Compatibility (bookkeeping sense) and confirmed P-Channel-Orthogonality is *not* yet closed. So the inner product is the honest open edge of an otherwise-closed arc.
- **Values inherited:** `ℏ` (form-identified in the operator papers, value inherited — see 012.5 / 012.6).

**Tier key** *(ED's own verdict tiers, from each paper's audit)*:
`Derived` (M1, from primitives) · `Grounded` (M2/M3 — structural/conditional; form-forced with an identified or inherited value) · `Inherited` (a value from measurement, e.g. `ℏ`) · `Synthesis` (compositional unification) · `Open` (the declared open edge). *(Verify against the paper's own status line before quoting; most here self-declare M2 or M3.)*

## The spine — read in this order

The clean path through the postulate emergence:

1. **[001 Pre-Individuation Amplitudes](Paper_001_PreIndividuation.md)** — amplitudes from P01–P04 (upstream of the Born rule).
2. **[003 The Born Rule](Paper_003_BornRule.md)** — probability = participation-frequency limit (the arc's anchor).
3. **[002 Tensor-Product Composition](Paper_002_TensorProduct.md)** — composite systems from P02 + P03.
4. **[005 Projective Measurement](Paper_005_ProjectiveMeasurement.md)** — measurement from P11 commitment.
5. **[006 Unitary Evolution](Paper_006_UnitaryEvolution.md)** — evolution from V1 kernel propagation.
6. **[007 Hilbert-Space Emergence](Paper_007_HilbertSpace.md)** — the state space as completion of the motif algebra (closes the 001→003→007 loop).
7. **[011.5 Four-Postulates Unification](Paper_011_5_FourPostulatesUnification.md)** — the four postulates under one participation measure.
