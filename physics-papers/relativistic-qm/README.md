# Relativistic-QM — Folder Guide

**What this folder is.** The relativistic quantum-mechanics arc (RQM, theorems T1–T10 + extensions): the Dirac and Klein-Gordon equations, spin-statistics, Lorentz representations, anyon prohibition in 3+1D, UV finiteness, the ℏ-origin, and the (partly open) mass and gauge structure — all from the substrate. This arc classifies the Weyl/Dirac representations and builds the relativistic wave equations; it is also where the **matter-sector spinor gate (Paper_106 / T4)** lives, which the whole chiral-gauge frontier (#2b) reduces to.

**State** *(authoritative source: `event-density/docs/ED_Research_Targets.md`, targets #2b + the RQM notes; PAPERS_INDEX)*:
- **Most of the arc is grounded/closed** — spin-statistics, frame uniqueness, anyon prohibition (two M1 pure-structural results), the wave equations, Lorentz reps, UV finiteness.
- **The load-bearing open edge is Paper_106 (T4, the Dirac equation):** the *structural mechanism* is identified (M2), but the explicit substrate-V1 → Dirac closed derivation — the emergent spinor — is **OPEN**. This is the T4 gate the chiral-gauge/parity frontier (#2b) reduces to; the single highest-leverage open item in the matter sector.
- **Also open:** the mass sector (Paper_113 — substrate-Higgs / substrate-Yukawa asserted, not derived) and P-Gauge existence (Paper_114 — the substrate derivation of P-Gauge is open).
- **Values inherited:** `ℏ` (Paper_112_hbar, structural origin identified but value inherited) and the canonical commutation constant (Paper_110).

**Tier key:** `Derived` (M1, pure structural / from primitives) · `Grounded` (M2/M3 — mechanism identified or form-forced) · `Inherited` (value from measurement, e.g. `ℏ`) · `Open` (the declared open edge — T4 spinor, mass, P-Gauge).
