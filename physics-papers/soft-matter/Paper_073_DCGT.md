## Preamble: What This Paper Does NOT Claim *(written first per QC discipline; abstract reconciled against this)*

1. **The 13 substrate primitives are not derived** (Paper_087).
2. **DCGT is not the only possible substrate→continuum bridge.** Other coarse-graining procedures (Wilsonian RG, hydrodynamic projection, mode-coupling) may apply in specific regimes; DCGT is the one substrate-level bridge derived from substrate-graph diffusion of V1/V5 content.
3. **DCGT does not derive continuum-level coupling constants or transport coefficients.** It supplies the *form* of continuum equations (diffusion-type, propagator-type, constitutive-law-type); the *coefficients* (diffusion constant, viscosity, conductivity, etc.) are inherited from value-layer empirical content and substrate-level matching at the coarse-graining scale.
4. **DCGT is regime-conditional.** It applies in the hydrodynamic-window scale separation $\ell_{\mathrm{ED}} \ll R_{\mathrm{cg}} \ll L_{\mathrm{flow}}$. Outside this window (strong-gradient regimes, near-substrate-scale physics, near-singularity regimes), DCGT breaks down.
5. **No claim that DCGT derives standard QFT renormalization.** DCGT operates one structural level below RG: it produces the continuum theory whose RG flow is then studied by standard techniques. The relationship between DCGT and Wilsonian RG is an active area (Papers in queue).
6. **DCGT is not a derivation of Einstein equations.** The substrate→continuum bridge produces flat-spacetime continuum equations under the standard hydrodynamic window; curvature emergence is the subject of the Arc ED-10 program, not DCGT.
7. **No claim that DCGT is exhaustive across all ED arcs.** Soft-matter Maxwell relaxation, gravity-arc cumulative-strain, BH-arc Hawking spectrum, and Q-COMPUTE multiplicity-cap behavior all use DCGT differently; the regime-specific applications are developed in arc-specific papers.

## Abstract

The **Diffusion Coarse-Graining Theorem (DCGT)** is the substrate→continuum bridge in the Event Density Generative Substrate Ontology: given the 13 postulated primitives (Paper_087) + V1 inheritance (Paper_089) + V5 dependence (Paper_090), substrate-level kernel-mediated content coarse-grains under the **hydrodynamic-window scale separation** $\ell_{\mathrm{ED}} \ll R_{\mathrm{cg}} \ll L_{\mathrm{flow}}$ to continuum diffusion-type / propagator-type / constitutive-law equations. The theorem has three load-bearing components: (1) **scale separation** — substrate-graph operations at scale $\ell_{\mathrm{ED}}$ produce well-defined coarse-grained content at scale $R_{\mathrm{cg}}$ that depends on macroscopic flows at scale $L_{\mathrm{flow}}$ but is decoupled from substrate microstructure; (2) **diffusion-form emergence** — V1's finite-width retarded envelope coarse-grains to a continuum diffusion operator under standard substrate-graph averaging; (3) **cross-domain instantiations** — DCGT produces continuum Maxwell relaxation in soft-matter (V5 soft-regime), retarded / Feynman / advanced propagator hierarchy in QFT (V5 QFT-regime), Lieb–Robinson velocity bound in condensed matter, and curved-spacetime entanglement at horizons (V5 BH-regime). The paper makes no claim that DCGT is the only substrate→continuum bridge, no claim of derivation of continuum-level transport coefficients, no claim of validity outside the hydrodynamic window, and no claim of curvature-emergence derivation. **Verdict per Paper_095: M3 (form-IDENTIFIED + value-INHERITED)** within the hydrodynamic-window scale-separation regime — diffusion-form emergence is substrate-derived (form); transport coefficients are inherited via empirical matching (value); regime is explicit A→regime scale-separation. The empirical case rests on cross-domain reach: DCGT is load-bearing for Paper_090 (V5 cross-chain kernel applications), the gravity arc (Papers_027/029/030/031), the BH arc (Papers_039/047), the soft-matter arc, and the entire Wave-3 corpus (Cos_01–Cos_06, Dyn_01–Dyn_05, GW_00–GW_02) which inherits DCGT as the substrate→continuum bridge at M3-equivalent level.

## 1. Introduction

Standard physics operates in the continuum (fields, propagators, diffusion equations, hydrodynamics); ED's substrate ontology operates on discrete substrate-graph content (chains, channels, polarity-transport, commitment). **DCGT is the bridge** — substrate-level kernel-mediated content coarse-grains under the hydrodynamic-window scale separation $\ell_{\mathrm{ED}} \ll R_{\mathrm{cg}} \ll L_{\mathrm{flow}}$ to continuum diffusion-type / propagator-type / constitutive-law equations.

The paper (i) states DCGT formally with the regime assumption explicit; (ii) derives diffusion-form emergence from V1 finite-width + substrate-graph averaging; (iii) catalogues cross-domain instantiations (Maxwell relaxation, QFT propagators, Lieb–Robinson velocity, KMS-thermal); (iv) specifies breakdown conditions.

**Corpus role.** DCGT is upstream of Paper_090 (V5 cross-domain), Paper_027 (Newton's $G$), Paper_039 + Paper_047 (BH arc), and is inherited by the entire Wave-3 corpus (Cos_01–Cos_06, Dyn_01–Dyn_05, GW_00–GW_02) as the substrate→continuum bridge at M3-equivalent inheritance level — every continuum-level empirical prediction in the corpus traces structurally through DCGT.

## 3. Setup — Scale Separation and Substrate-Graph Averaging

### 3.1 The hydrodynamic-window scale separation (regime assumption)

DCGT operates in the **hydrodynamic-window scale separation**:

$$
\ell_{\mathrm{ED}} \ll R_{\mathrm{cg}} \ll L_{\mathrm{flow}}.
$$

where:

- $\ell_{\mathrm{ED}}$: substrate scale (Primitive P08).
- $R_{\mathrm{cg}}$: coarse-graining scale — the spatial / temporal extent over which substrate-graph content is averaged to produce continuum-level quantities.
- $L_{\mathrm{flow}}$: macroscopic flow scale — the spatial / temporal extent over which continuum-level quantities vary appreciably.

**This is a regime assumption, not a derivation.** DCGT's conclusions apply when the scale separation holds. Outside this window (e.g., $R_{\mathrm{cg}} \sim \ell_{\mathrm{ED}}$, near-substrate-scale; or $R_{\mathrm{cg}} \sim L_{\mathrm{flow}}$, near-flow-scale), DCGT breaks down (§7).

In practice, $R_{\mathrm{cg}}$ is chosen anywhere in the scale-separated window; coarse-grained quantities are insensitive to the specific choice within the window (the hallmark of effective-theory regime stability).

### 3.2 Substrate-graph averaging

A **substrate-graph average** of a substrate-level quantity $\mathcal{Q}(u, t)$ at coarse-graining scale $R_{\mathrm{cg}}$ is:

$$
\langle \mathcal{Q}\rangle_{R_{\mathrm{cg}}}(\bar{u}, \bar{t}) = \frac{1}{V_{R_{\mathrm{cg}}}}\int_{|u - \bar{u}| < R_{\mathrm{cg}}}\int_{|t - \bar{t}| < R_{\mathrm{cg}}/c}\mathcal{Q}(u, t)\,d\mu_{\mathrm{substrate-graph}}
$$

where $V_{R_{\mathrm{cg}}}$ is the substrate-graph volume of the coarse-graining cell and $d\mu_{\mathrm{substrate-graph}}$ is the substrate-graph measure (substrate channels per substrate cell).

**Well-definedness.** By P03 (spatial homogeneity), translation-invariance of substrate-graph operations means the average depends only on $(\bar{u}, \bar{t})$ — the coarse-graining center — not on the specific substrate channels enumerated within the cell. By P04 (bandwidth additivity), substrate bandwidth contributions sum additively within the cell.

**Dimensional check:** $\langle\mathcal{Q}\rangle_{R_{\mathrm{cg}}}$ has the same dimensions as $\mathcal{Q}$ (averaging is dimensionless). ✓

### 3.3 What survives coarse-graining

Substrate-level content that varies on scales $\sim \ell_{\mathrm{ED}}$ is **averaged out**: substrate-graph microstructure (specific channel labels, specific commitment-event timings) becomes invisible at scale $R_{\mathrm{cg}}$.

Substrate-level content that varies on scales $\sim L_{\mathrm{flow}}$ **survives**: macroscopic flows of bandwidth, polarity, strain content are captured by the coarse-graining.

Substrate-level content at the intermediate scale $\sim R_{\mathrm{cg}}$ has partial visibility: it depends on the specific $R_{\mathrm{cg}}$ choice within the scale-separated window.

## 4. V1 Kernel → Continuum Diffusion Operator

### 4.1 V1 envelope at substrate-graph scale

By Paper_089, V1 has the canonical form:

$$
K_{V1}(x, x') = \theta(t - t')\,G(\sigma(x, x')/\ell_{\mathrm{ED}}^2).
$$

The envelope $G$ is bounded, finite-width with characteristic scale $\ell_{\mathrm{ED}}$, decaying outside the substrate-graph scale.

### 4.2 Coarse-graining V1 to a diffusion-type operator

Coarse-grain V1 at scale $R_{\mathrm{cg}}$ via the substrate-graph averaging of §3.2. For separations $|x - x'| \gg \ell_{\mathrm{ED}}$, the V1 envelope $G(\sigma/\ell_{\mathrm{ED}}^2)$ becomes effectively local at scale $R_{\mathrm{cg}}$ — the kernel acts like a **point-supported operator** with effective range $\ell_{\mathrm{ED}} \ll R_{\mathrm{cg}}$.

The continuum-limit operator $\hat{D}_{\mathrm{cont}}$ defined by:

$$
\hat{D}_{\mathrm{cont}}\,\psi(x) = \int K_{V1}(x, x')\,\psi(x')\,d^4x'
$$

(restricted to retarded support) reduces in the hydrodynamic window to a **local differential operator** acting on the coarse-grained field $\psi(\bar{x})$. The standard expansion (Taylor in $(x - x')/R_{\mathrm{cg}}$ to second order; constant + first + second derivative terms) gives:

$$
\hat{D}_{\mathrm{cont}}\,\psi(\bar{x}) \approx \left[a_0 + a_1\,\partial_t + D\,\nabla^2 + \mathcal{O}(\partial^3)\right]\psi(\bar{x})
$$

where:

- $a_0$ = $\int G\,d^4(\Delta x)$ (zeroth-moment integral of the V1 envelope).
- $a_1$ = $\int G\,\Delta t\,d^4(\Delta x)$ (first-moment in time).
- $D$ = $(1/6)\int G\,|\Delta\vec{x}|^2\,d^4(\Delta x)$ (second-moment in space; gives diffusion constant).

**Dimensional check:** $\hat{D}_{\mathrm{cont}}$ has dimensions of $[1/\mathrm{time}]$ when $G$ has dimensions $[1/\mathrm{length}^3 \cdot 1/\mathrm{time}]$ (for 3+1 D propagator-density convention); $D$ has dimensions $[\mathrm{length}^2/\mathrm{time}]$ as expected for diffusion constant. ✓

### 4.3 Diffusion-form result

In the hydrodynamic window, V1's coarse-grained action on substrate content reduces to a **diffusion-type continuum operator**:

$$
\hat{D}_{\mathrm{cont}} \approx \partial_t - D\,\nabla^2 + (\text{higher-order corrections})
$$

(after suitable normalization absorbing the zeroth-moment $a_0$). This is the substrate→continuum diffusion form: V1 cross-chain content propagates at the substrate level via finite-width retarded kernel, and coarse-grains to a continuum diffusion equation with diffusion constant $D$ set by V1's second-moment substrate-graph structure.

### 4.4 Where the diffusion constant comes from

The numerical value of $D$ is set by:

- V1's specific functional shape (envelope details inherited from substrate-coefficient anchoring).
- The substrate scale $\ell_{\mathrm{ED}}$.

For a generic V1 envelope $G \sim e^{-\sigma/\ell_{\mathrm{ED}}^2}$, $D \sim \ell_{\mathrm{ED}}^2/\tau_{V1}$ where $\tau_{V1} \sim \ell_{\mathrm{ED}}/c$. This gives $D \sim c\ell_{\mathrm{ED}}$ at the substrate scale.

In specific regimes (soft-matter, condensed-matter, BH), the effective $D$ is renormalized by substrate-coefficient matching to empirical values — **value-layer empirical content**, not substrate-derived. DCGT supplies the *form* (diffusion equation); the *coefficient* is matched.

---

## 5. V5 Kernel → Continuum Memory-Kernel Diffusion

### 5.1 V5 envelope

By Paper_090, V5 has the canonical form:

$$
K_{V5}(u_A, t_A; u_B, t_B) = \theta(t_A - t_B)\,F_{V5}(\sigma/\ell_{V5}^2, (t_A - t_B)/\tau_{V5}).
$$

V5 has both finite spatial extent ($\ell_{V5}$) and finite memory time ($\tau_{V5}$).

### 5.2 Coarse-graining V5 to memory-kernel diffusion

The same substrate-graph averaging of §3.2 applied to V5 yields a **memory-kernel diffusion operator** in the continuum:

$$
\hat{D}_{\mathrm{cont}}^{V5}\,\psi(\bar{x}, \bar{t}) = \int_0^\infty d\tau\,\mathcal{M}(\tau)\left[D_{V5}\,\nabla^2\psi(\bar{x}, \bar{t} - \tau) - \psi(\bar{x}, \bar{t} - \tau)/\tau_{V5}\right]
$$

where $\mathcal{M}(\tau)$ is the **memory kernel** inherited from V5's temporal envelope $F_{V5}$, $D_{V5}$ is the V5 diffusion constant (analog of §4.3), and $\tau_{V5}$ is the V5 memory time.

**Dimensional check:** $\mathcal{M}(\tau)$ has dimensions $[1/\mathrm{time}]$; $D_{V5}\nabla^2\psi$ has $[\psi/\mathrm{time}]$; $\psi/\tau_{V5}$ has $[\psi/\mathrm{time}]$; integral $\int d\tau$ has $[\mathrm{time}]$; total: $\hat{D}_{\mathrm{cont}}^{V5}\psi$ has $[\psi]$ — consistent with $\hat{D}$ being a differential / integral operator. ✓

### 5.3 Markovian limit

In the **Markovian limit** $\tau_{V5} \to 0$ (V5 memory time fast compared to flow timescale $L_{\mathrm{flow}}/c$), the memory kernel becomes $\mathcal{M}(\tau) \to \delta(\tau)$, and the operator reduces to a Markovian diffusion + decay form:

$$
\hat{D}_{\mathrm{cont}}^{V5,\,\mathrm{Markov}} \approx D_{V5}\,\nabla^2 - 1/\tau_{V5}.
$$

This is the substrate-level structural origin of standard Markovian diffusion + exponential relaxation in soft-matter (§6.1) and condensed-matter (§6.3) contexts.

### 5.4 Non-Markovian regime

In the **non-Markovian regime** ($\tau_{V5}$ comparable to flow timescale), the full memory kernel $\mathcal{M}(\tau)$ contributes. The resulting continuum equation is a **generalized diffusion equation with memory**:

$$
\partial_t\psi(\bar{x}, t) = \int_0^t \mathcal{M}(t - t')\,D_{V5}\,\nabla^2\psi(\bar{x}, t')\,dt' - \psi/\tau_{V5}.
$$

This is the substrate-level structural origin of non-Markovian behavior in soft-matter (Maxwell viscoelastic response with frequency-dependent moduli) and BH-radiation (non-thermal corrections to Hawking spectrum, Paper_047).

---

## 6. Cross-Domain Instantiations

### 6.1 Soft-matter Maxwell relaxation — form derived, value empirically matched

**Form (derived).** DCGT applied to V5 in the soft-matter Markovian limit (§5.3) produces the **exponential-decay form** of the Maxwell stress-relaxation modulus:

$$
G(t) = G_0\,e^{-t/\tau_{V5}^{\mathrm{soft}}}.
$$

The exponential form is a substrate-level structural consequence of V5's Markovian-limit envelope (§5.3).

**Numerical value (empirically matched, not derived).** In the soft-matter regime, $\tau_{V5}^{\mathrm{soft}}$ is **identified with the empirically-measured Maxwell relaxation time** $\tau_{\mathrm{Maxwell}}^{\mathrm{empirical}}$ via direct empirical matching:

$$
\tau_{V5}^{\mathrm{soft}} = \tau_{\mathrm{Maxwell}}^{\mathrm{empirical}} \quad \text{(empirical matching, not substrate-derived)}.
$$

**Honest framing (round-3 QC):** The numerical value of $\tau_{V5}^{\mathrm{soft}}$ in any specific polymer system is **inherited from rheometry** — it is the empirically-measured Maxwell relaxation time for that system. DCGT supplies the *form* (exponential decay); the *coefficient* $\tau_{V5}^{\mathrm{soft}}$ is matched to empirical data, not derived from substrate primitives.

Krieger–Dougherty viscosity and Cross / Carreau / Bird–Carreau constitutive laws emerge as DCGT continuum limits in different soft-matter regimes (high shear, low shear, multi-mode), with each regime's specific numerical coefficients similarly inherited via empirical matching.

### 6.2 QFT propagator hierarchy

In the QFT regime, V1/V5 coarse-graining (§4 + §5) produces standard QFT propagators:

- **Retarded propagator** $G_R$: V1 retarded support coarse-grained to continuum retarded propagator.
- **Feynman propagator** $G_F$: Wick rotation of V1 + V5 in the Euclidean continuation.
- **Advanced propagator** $G_A$: from $G_R$ via mathematical compositional closure (Paper_089 §6.1); not directly substrate-operational but mathematically derivable from $G_R$ via complex-analytic methods.

V1 finite-width supplies the substrate-level UV cutoff $\omega_c = c/\ell_{\mathrm{ED}}$ that becomes the standard QFT regulator (Pauli–Villars, dimensional, lattice) in the continuum limit.

### 6.3 Lieb–Robinson velocity bound — form by dimensional analogy

**A→dimensional-analogy (not derivation).** In the condensed-matter regime, DCGT applied to V5 in the Markovian limit suggests, **by dimensional analysis matching to the standard Lieb–Robinson theorem**, a velocity bound for entanglement-content propagation:

$$
v_{LR} \sim c_{V5}\cdot\frac{\ell_{V5}}{\tau_{V5}^{\mathrm{ent}}}.
$$

**Honest framing (round-3 QC):** This is **dimensional analogy**, not substrate-level derivation. The standard Lieb–Robinson theorem (Lieb–Robinson 1972 + later refinements) is a tight commutator-norm bound from Hamiltonian locality; its derivation requires Hamiltonian-level analysis of bounded local operators. ED's substrate-level $v_{LR}$ form is obtained by matching the substrate-level scales $\ell_{V5}$ and $\tau_{V5}^{\mathrm{ent}}$ to the standard LR-velocity dimensional structure. **The substrate-level mechanism that would derive an LR-type *tight* bound from substrate primitives alone is not supplied in this paper; it is invoked by dimensional analogy to the standard result.** The substrate-level $v_{LR}$ form is a defensible identification at the dimensional level, but it does not constitute a substrate-level proof of the Lieb–Robinson theorem.

### 6.4 BH curved-spacetime entanglement and KMS

In the BH near-horizon regime, V5 acquires imaginary-time periodicity (Paper_047 §3). DCGT applied to V5 in the Euclidean continuation produces the substrate-level KMS condition:

$$
\langle\phi(t_A)\phi(t_B)\rangle_{V5}^{\mathrm{Eucl}} = \langle\phi(t_A + i\beta_H)\phi(t_B)\rangle_{V5}^{\mathrm{Eucl}}, \quad \beta_H = 2\pi/\kappa,
$$

giving thermal Planck spectrum at $T_H = \kappa/(2\pi)$ (Paper_047 §4). The full Hawking spectrum derivation, including the substrate-level non-thermal $(\omega/\omega_c)^2$ corrections, is the subject of Paper_047.

### 6.5 The procedural unity

The four instantiations (§6.1–§6.4) are not four independent mechanisms — they are **one substrate→continuum procedure (DCGT) applied to one substrate primitive (V5)** across four regimes that differ in regime-specific $\tau_{V5}$, $\ell_{V5}$, and substrate-source content. The procedural unity is the cross-domain coherence claim of DCGT (paralleling Paper_090's structural unification of formalism across regimes).

---

## 7. DCGT Breakdown Conditions

### 7.1 Strong-gradient regimes

In regimes where $L_{\mathrm{flow}} \to R_{\mathrm{cg}}$ (gradient scale approaches coarse-graining scale), DCGT breaks down: the scale separation $R_{\mathrm{cg}} \ll L_{\mathrm{flow}}$ fails.

**Empirical signature of breakdown:** continuum equations derived via DCGT no longer match substrate-level mechanism predictions. Specific examples:

- Shock waves: gradient scale collapses to substrate scale.
- Near-singularity content in BH evaporation late-stage.
- Strong-coupling soft-matter (gels, glasses) where collective-mode wavelength approaches $\ell_{V5}$.

### 7.2 Near-substrate-scale regimes

In regimes where $R_{\mathrm{cg}} \to \ell_{\mathrm{ED}}$ (coarse-graining scale approaches substrate scale), DCGT cannot resolve substrate-graph microstructure cleanly. Substrate-level effects (kernel finite-width, V5 memory, commitment-event statistics) become visible at coarse-grained level.

**Empirical signature of breakdown:** continuum equations require substrate-level corrections that scale as $(\ell_{\mathrm{ED}}/R_{\mathrm{cg}})^n$ for some $n > 0$. Specific examples:

- Trans-Planckian regime in Hawking spectrum (Paper_039 / Paper_047 — V5 cutoff at $\omega_c = c/\ell_P$).
- Sub-Planckian length-scale probes (hypothetical future high-energy physics).
- Near-Planck-mass BH evaporation late-stage (Paper_039 §6 — remnant scale).

### 7.3 Near-singularity regimes

In regimes where substrate-level stability-landscape gradients (P12) become large enough to trigger substrate-level commitment-event proliferation, DCGT's averaging breaks down because commitment events at substrate-scale are not coarse-grain-able.

**Empirical signature of breakdown:** discrete substrate-level commitment statistics become visible in continuum measurements. Specific examples:

- Quantum-measurement events at substrate-graph scale.
- Near-horizon information-blocking transitions (Paper_039 §3 — UR-1.2 failure).

### 7.4 Strong-curvature regimes (Arc ED-10 territory)

DCGT operates in flat-spacetime (or approximately-flat) regime. Strong-curvature regimes (near singularities, near horizons at substrate scale) require the Arc ED-10 curvature-emergence framework, not DCGT directly. The relationship between DCGT and Arc ED-10 is in-queue.

---

## 8. Falsification Criteria

### 8.1 Continuum equations fail to match substrate-level predictions + procedural-unity failure

**Falsifier:** Empirical demonstration that continuum-level equations derived via DCGT (Maxwell relaxation, Newtonian potential, Hawking spectrum, Lieb–Robinson velocity) fail to match substrate-level predictions within the hydrodynamic-window scale separation — systematic discrepancies that cannot be absorbed into value-layer coefficient adjustment — would falsify DCGT. Equivalently: empirical demonstration that the four cross-domain instantiations (§6.1–§6.4) require *different* substrate→continuum procedures rather than one DCGT applied across regimes would falsify the procedural-unity claim and reduce DCGT's cross-domain wedge content.

### 8.2 Hydrodynamic-window failure or breakdown-pattern violation

**Falsifier:** Empirical demonstration that DCGT breaks down in a regime that should satisfy $\ell_{\mathrm{ED}} \ll R_{\mathrm{cg}} \ll L_{\mathrm{flow}}$, *or* that breakdown in strong-gradient regimes (§7.1) follows a pattern inconsistent with substrate-graph commitment-event proliferation, would falsify §3.1's scale-separation regime condition + the §7 breakdown taxonomy jointly.

### 8.3 Diffusion-form failure

**Falsifier:** Empirical demonstration that V1 coarse-graining does not produce a diffusion-type operator in the continuum limit — e.g., produces a non-local integral operator at scales $R_{\mathrm{cg}} \gg \ell_{\mathrm{ED}}$ — would falsify §4's diffusion-form derivation.

### 8.4 Memory-kernel structure failure

**Falsifier:** Empirical demonstration that V5 coarse-graining does not produce a memory-kernel operator with structure inherited from V5 envelope — e.g., that soft-matter Maxwell relaxation does not follow the predicted memory-kernel form — would falsify §5.

---

## 9. Position Statement

This paper sits within the substrate-ontology research-program lineage ('t Hooft cellular-automaton; Wolfram Ruliad / hypergraph-rewriting; causal-set program, Sorkin et al.), not within the operational-reconstruction lineage (Hardy 2001, CDP 2011, Coecke-Kissinger). Methodology per Paper_095 (form-FORCED / value-INHERITED).

The **Diffusion Coarse-Graining Theorem (DCGT)** is the substrate→continuum bridge in the ED Generative Primitives System. Given the postulated primitives + V1 inheritance + V5 dependence + the hydrodynamic-window scale separation $\ell_{\mathrm{ED}} \ll R_{\mathrm{cg}} \ll L_{\mathrm{flow}}$ (regime condition), substrate-level kernel-mediated content coarse-grains to continuum diffusion-type / propagator-type / constitutive-law equations: V1 → diffusion operator (§4); V5 → memory-kernel diffusion (§5); cross-domain instantiations across soft-matter (Maxwell relaxation), QFT (propagator hierarchy), condensed-matter (Lieb–Robinson velocity), and BH (KMS-thermal structure) (§6). The procedural unity — one substrate→continuum procedure applied across multiple regimes — is the cross-domain coherence claim of DCGT. Breakdown conditions (§7) specify where substrate-level mechanism is *not* captured by continuum description (strong-gradient, near-substrate-scale, near-singularity, strong-curvature regimes); these breakdowns are predictions, not failures, and provide falsifiability handles distinguishing ED from continuum-only frameworks.

**Verdict: M3 (form-IDENTIFIED + value-INHERITED) within hydrodynamic-window scale-separation regime** per Paper_095 §3.3. Form derived via V1/V5 coarse-graining + diffusion-form emergence + memory-kernel structure + cross-domain instantiations; values inherited (Maxwell $\tau$, transport coefficients, regime-specific parameters); regime explicit (A→regime hydrodynamic-window). Five-anchor verdict-sync: status / Abstract / §1 / audit verdict row / this §9 all M3.

What this paper claims: given the postulated primitives + V1/V5 + hydrodynamic-window regime, DCGT produces continuum diffusion-type / propagator-type equations as substrate-level structural consequences; the four cross-domain instantiations are one substrate→continuum procedure applied to one substrate primitive (V5) across regimes; DCGT is load-bearing for Papers_027 (Newton), 047 (Hawking), 090 (V5 cross-domain), 056 (Class-A coarse-grained matching), and the entire Wave-3 corpus (Cos_01–Cos_06, Dyn_01–Dyn_05, GW_00–GW_02) inheriting at M3-equivalent level.

What this paper does *not* claim: the substrate primitives are not derived (Paper_087); DCGT is not the only substrate→continuum bridge; continuum-level transport coefficients are not derived but inherited; DCGT does not apply outside the hydrodynamic window; DCGT does not derive Einstein equations or standard QFT renormalization; the Lieb–Robinson identification (§6.3) is A→position dimensional-analogy framing, not substrate-graph derivation.

The empirical case rests on cross-domain reach: DCGT is load-bearing across multiple arcs; falsification in any arc traces back to DCGT or to the arc-specific application.
