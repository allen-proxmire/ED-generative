# Soft-Matter — Folder Guide *(fluids, Navier-Stokes, rheology, DCGT)*

**What this folder is.** The soft-matter / continuum-fluids sector, and the home of the **DCGT (Diffusion Coarse-Graining Theorem, Paper_073)** — the substrate→continuum bridge invoked across the whole corpus. It covers the Navier-Stokes program (dimensional forcing to 3+1, the smoothness question, the turbulence cascade, vortex stretching), rheology (Krieger-Dougherty + Maxwell viscoelastic), MHD closure, the empirically-validated universal mobility law, and metamaterials.

**State** *(sources: `event-density/docs/ED_Research_Targets.md` — soft-matter is in the CLOSED column; targets #3, #5; PAPERS_INDEX)*:
- **The arc is CLOSED.** DCGT (073) is the foundational coarse-graining theorem the rest of the corpus builds on.
- **Navier-Stokes:** dimensional forcing to 3+1 (075), the substrate→continuum bridge (076), a smoothness mechanism (077, Clay-adjacent), and the turbulence cascade (078). Grounded/conditional (declared PDE-uniqueness axioms).
- **The universal mobility law (085) is data-validated** — the constitutive law `M ∝ (ρ_max − ρ)^β` matched across 11 materials (`R² > 0.986`); the empirical anchor of the sector (and the capacity ingredient of the UDM, target #3).
- **Honest boundary:** Paper_082 triangulates **advection and kinematic induction as *non-ED-native*** — lossy ≠ wrong; not every continuum effect is a direct substrate shadow.
- **`Q ≈ 3.5` (080)** is canon-internal (one of SCBU's six projections, #5), not derived from primitives.

**Tier key:** `Grounded` (conditional/structural, M2/M3) · `Measured` (empirically validated, e.g. the mobility law) · `Inherited` (a value from the standard form) · `Synthesis` · `Non-ED` (triangulated as not substrate-native — an honest boundary).
